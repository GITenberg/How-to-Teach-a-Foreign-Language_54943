<p>“It appeals not only to specialists, but to all who concern
themselves with that most fascinating of modern questions,
the origin and development of speech. The opening chapter
shows us the independent thinker and original investigator.
Throughout, the destructive criticism is clear, incisive, and
cogent. It cannot fail to affect in time even the manual-mongers
and the examiners who expect the innocent school to reproduce
the fictions of the cram-books. A philologist, who sees with
his own eyes and sees straight, is a rare combination.”&mdash;<cite>Journal
of Education.</cite></p>

<p>“Mr. Jespersen, who is still young, has long ago gained a
high reputation as a phonetician. The introductory essay
prefixed to the tracts before us will, we believe, secure for him
a distinguished position among philological thinkers. It is long
since we read so brilliant a performance of its kind.”&mdash;<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p>“Our readers will find the book as instructive as it is far
removed from the dryness characteristic of most philological
treatises. It furnishes material for deep thought and may
almost be called a new starting-point in philology.”&mdash;<cite>Asiatic
Quarterly Review.</cite></p>

<p>“The book is historical in its method, and attempts to show,
by an examination of the typical characteristics of languages
in all stages of development, what the general drift of language
has been.”&mdash;<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>


<p>When, in accordance with a wish expressed by English
and American friends, I determined to have my <cite lang="da" xml:lang="da">Sprogundervisning</cite>
translated into English, I found it difficult
to decide what to retain and what to leave out of the
original. So much of what I had written appeared to
me to apply more or less exclusively to Danish schools
and Danish methods, and I had too little personal experience
of the practice of English teachers or of English
school-books to be quite sure of the advisability in each
case of including or excluding this or that remark. I
have, however, made my choice to the best of my ability,
and if some parts of my criticism are not altogether
applicable to English methods, I hope I may be excused
on the plea that what is now the really important thing
is less the destruction of bad old methods than a positive
indication of the new ways to be followed if we are to
have thoroughly efficient teaching in modern languages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I</h2>


<p>About twenty years ago, when I began to be interested
in a reformation of the teaching of modern languages,
there were not, as there are now, numerous books and
articles on the subject, but merely scattered hints,
especially in the works of Sweet and Storm. It was not
long, however, before the movement found itself well under
headway, especially in Germany. In Scandinavia it
began at the appearance of the adaptation which I had
made of Felix Franke’s capital little pamphlet, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
praktische spracherlernung auf grund der psychologie und
der physiologie der sprache</span>.” At just about the same
time, Western in Norway and Lundell in Sweden came
forward with similar ideas, and at the Philological Congress
in Stockholm in 1886 we three struck a blow for reform.
We founded a society, of course, and we gave it the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quousque tandem</i> (which for the benefit of those not acquainted
with Latin may be rendered “Cannot we soon put an end
to this?”), that Ciceronian flourish with which Viëtor had
shortly before heralded his powerful little pamphlet, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Der
sprachunterricht muss umkehren</span>.” Our Scandinavian
society published some small pamphlets, and for a time
even a little quarterly paper. But the movement soon
reached that second and more important stage when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
teachers began to put the reform into practice and when
the editors of school-books began to give it more and more
consideration, until at present it may be said that the
reformed method is well on the way to permanent favour,
at least as far as younger teachers have anything to say in
the matter.</p>

<p>What is the method, then, that I allude to? Well, if
the question means, what is it called, I find myself in some
embarrassment, for the method resembles other pet children
in this respect, that it has many names. Though none
of these are quite adequate, yet if I mention them all, I can
perhaps give a little preliminary notion of what the matter
is all about. The method is by some called the “new” or
“newer”; in England often “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die neuere richtung</span>”; by
others the “reform-method,” again the “natural,” the
“rational,” the “correct,” or “sensible” (why not praise
one’s wares as all dealers do in their advertisements?); the
“direct” comes a little nearer, the “phonetical” indicates
something of its character, but not nearly enough, likewise
the “phonetical transcription method,” for phonetics and
phonetical transcription is not all; the “imitative” again
emphasizes another point; the “analytical” (as contrasted
with the constructive) could perhaps also be applied to
other methods; the “concrete” calls attention to something
essential, but so does the German “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">anschauungsmethode</span>”
too; “the conversation-method” reminds us perhaps too
much of Berlitz schools; words with “anti,” like the “anticlassical,”
“antigrammatical,” or “antitranslation” method,
are clumsy and stupidly negative&mdash;so there is nothing left
for us but to give up the attempt to find a name, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
recognize that this difficulty is due to the fact that it is not
one thing, but many things that we have to reform, and that
is of course the reason why the reformers themselves fall
into so many sub-parties: the one lays all the stress on
one point, the other on another point. However, there is
certainly enough to do for any one who wants to get better
results out of the teaching of foreign languages than have
hitherto been the rule.</p>

<p>It also speaks much in favour of the reform that it is
impossible to name the “new” method after some founder,
just as in olden days we had Lancaster’s, Hamilton’s,
Jacotot’s methods; later, Robertson’s, Ollendorff’s, Ahn’s,
Toussaint-Langenscheidt’s, Plötz’s, Listov’s methods, and
as we of later years have Berlitz’s and Gouin’s methods
for the teaching of foreign languages. If in old Norse
mythology, the god Heimdall had nine mothers, our reform-method
has at least seven wise fathers. In this respect it
differs essentially from all the methods just mentioned: each
one of them is named after a single man, and he in return
is as a rule only remembered as the originator of his method.
Our method, on the other hand, owes its origin to men who,
for other reasons, may claim a place among the most
eminent linguistic scholars of the last decades (Sweet,
Storm, Sievers, Sayce, Lundell, and others), and the ideas
which they have conceived have been adopted and applied
to life with many practical innovations and changes by a
large number of educators and schoolmasters (I may
mention almost at random Klinghardt, Walter, Kühn,
Dörr, Quiehl, Rossmann, Wendt, Widgery, Western,
Brekke); on the boundary between both groups stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
especially Viëtor and Paul Passy. That shows that
it is not with theoretical sophistries that we have to do; it
is not the whim of one man, but the sum of all the best
linguistical and pedagogical ideas of our times, which,
coming from many different sources, have found each other,
and have made a beautiful alliance for the purpose of overturning
the old routine. Modern languages, which were
formerly treated like Cinderella in our schools and universities,
begin to feel of age, and want to have a word
to say, because they cannot put up with various arrangements
which may have been more or less satisfactory for the
classical languages, but do not suit modern languages at all.
These want to be treated as <em>living</em>, and the method of
teaching them must be as elastic and adaptable as life is
restless and variable.</p>

<p>What is the <em>object</em> in the teaching of modern languages?
Well, why have we our native tongue? Certainly in order
to get the most out of a life lived in a community of our
fellow-countrymen, in order to exchange thoughts, feelings
and wishes with them, both by receiving something of their
psychical contents and by communicating to them something
of what dwells in us. Language is not an end in itself,
just as little as railway tracks; it is a way of connection
between souls, a means of communication. And it is not
even the only one; expression of countenance, gesture, etc.,
yes, even a forcible box on the ear can tell me what is
taking place in the mind of one of my fellow-creatures. But
language is the most complete, the richest, the best means
of communication; it bridges the psychical chasm between
individuals in manifold cases when they otherwise would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
wander about isolated and cut off from all intelligent
sympathy.</p>

<p>The purpose in learning foreign languages, then, must be
in order to get a way of communication with places which
our native tongue cannot reach, for there too may be
persons with whom I, for some reason or other, desire
to exchange thoughts, or at least from whom I wish to
receive thoughts. And herein really lies already the answer
to the question: which languages shall we give the preference?
Compare the advantage of being able to talk with
the inhabitants of the Fiji Islands in their own language
with the advantage of being conversant with French or
German. If all that we desire or all that we can ever
hope to attain in any one language is to receive thoughts,
to acquaint ourselves with the works of foreign authors,
while we ourselves neither expect nor wish to be able to
impart our own thoughts in it, it is always a question if it
is not better to use translations than to learn the language
itself, especially in the case of the dead languages. A
translation is, to be sure, no perfect substitute for the
original, but on the other hand one has to know the foreign
language pretty well in order to get more out of the original
than out of the translation. Then how does the balance
stand between the debit-side&mdash;the work of learning the
language&mdash;and the credit-side&mdash;the extra profit thus to be
got from the authors’ works? It is of course a question
which must be decided separately for every individual case,
and there are many circumstances which may have to be
considered; but most people will not lose anything if they
read Tolstoi or Omar Khayyám in English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The objection may be raised that there are also other
reasons for learning foreign languages. A student of comparative
philology, for instance, studies languages for their
own sake, without caring if they can serve him as a means
of learning anything that he did not know before, or that
he could learn much more conveniently in some other
way; he may often be very much interested in languages
which have no literature at all, or which are spoken by
peoples with whom he never comes into contact. But this
study, which may be compared to the study of other means
of communication for their own sake, locomotive-construction,
railway signal-service, etc.&mdash;only that it is probably
much more interesting&mdash;is clearly a special study, which
has nothing to do with the reasons why people generally
learn languages. Although it undoubtedly is an advantage
for every educated person to know something about the life
of language, yet I think it will suffice for me merely to touch
upon the theoretical study of languages here and there in
the following pages, so much the more as it is never with
this end in view that any language is placed on the school
programme.</p>

<p>Neither were Latin and Greek introduced into our schools
for the sake of training the pupils in logic, no matter how
much it may occasionally be insisted upon that exactly this
is their real value. But it is not necessary to waste many
words on this matter, especially since all competent classical
scholars&mdash;also those who insist upon a privileged position
for the classical languages in our schools&mdash;have long ago
given up as unscholarly the idea that the Latin (or Greek)
language should be more logical in construction than, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
instance, French or English. And there is no doubt much
truth in what Robert Browning says: “Learning Greek
teaches Greek, and nothing else; certainly not common
sense, if that have failed to precede the teaching!”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But on the other hand it must not be overlooked that
everything which is learned with a sensible end in view, and
according to a sensible method, tends in itself more or less
directly to develop valuable faculties, and that especially
the teaching of languages, in addition to the actual results
which it gives through the contents of what one reads in
foreign languages, is an excellent means of training such
important faculties <span class="lock">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the faculty of observing (of observing correctly, of
observing independently),</p>

<p>the faculty of classifying under different points of view
that which has been observed,</p>

<p>the faculty of deducing general laws from the material
collected by observation,</p>

<p>the faculty of drawing conclusions and applying them
to other cases than the ones hitherto met with,</p></div>

<p>&mdash;all, of course, faculties that are nearly related&mdash;also</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the ability to read in general, to read intelligently, and
with reflection.</p></div>

<p>In the construction of our method of teaching, especially
if it is to be used in schools, we must also take these things
into consideration. Any instruction in languages which
merely consisted in a parrot-like repetition of the words of
the teacher or the book, if indeed such a method is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ceivable,
would not be in place in our schools, and besides,
no one, so far as I know, has ever tried to introduce such a
pure parrot-method there.</p>

<p>The teacher must make the pupils feel interested in the
subject; they must have a vivid conception of the reward
that their work will bring them, so that it will seem worth
while for them to exert themselves. They must feel that
their instruction in languages gives them a key, and that
there are plenty of treasures that it will open for them;
they must see that the literature to which they have gained
access contains numerous works which also have messages
for them; and they must, to so great an extent as possible
in the course of the instruction in a certain language, also
have got an interest in the land and people concerned, so
that they themselves will make an effort to extend their
knowledge about these things. There is thus laid a good
foundation for their whole life&mdash;and the saying “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non scholæ
sed vitæ</span>” ought not to be interpreted, as too many (especially
parents) do: learn not for the school, but in order to
pass a good examination, so that you may prosper in life,
and by virtue of your examination get a good position.
The school ought to equip its youth in the very best
manner for life, and the teacher ought not out of consideration
for examination requirements to neglect or hinder
anything which otherwise is good. A word about examinations
later; here I simply want to warn the teacher against
troubling the examination until the examination troubles
him. Many of the things which I have to recommend in
the following pages, I have time and again heard teachers
recognize as really sensible, but they are only afraid of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
on account of the examination for which they have to prepare
their pupils. The answer to that is, teach in the right
way, then there will be life and love in it all, and when the
examination comes your pupils will know more than if your
teaching from the very beginning had been fettered by
examination requirements. The pupils really learn most
when they continually have a feeling that it is all something
useful and valuable, and that it is not too far elevated above
that actual life which they either know or are beginning to
get some notion of.</p>

<p>We learn languages, then (our native tongue as well as
others), so as to be enabled to get sensible first-hand communications
about the thoughts of others, and so as to have
for ourselves too (if possible) a means of making others
partakers of our own thoughts; and if we consider what
kind of communications we may be more likely to get
through a foreign language than through our own, the
highest purpose in the teaching of languages may perhaps
be said to be the access to the best thoughts and
institutions of a foreign nation, its literature, culture&mdash;in
short, the spirit of the nation in the widest sense of the
word. But at the same time we must remember that we
cannot reach the goal with one bound, and that there are
many other things on the way which are also worth taking
in. We do not learn our native tongue merely so as to be
able to read Shakespeare and Browning, and neither do we
learn it for the sake of giving orders to the shoemaker or
making out the washerwoman’s bill. So likewise in the case
of foreign languages, we ought not exclusively to soar above
the earth, nor on the other hand exclusively to grovel on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the ground; between those two spheres there are large
fields in manifold shades where it might be of great value
for us to stand in direct communication with other
nations.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>


<p>We may already from what has been said draw some
conclusions as to the method which we ought to use. We
ought to learn a language through sensible communications;
there must be (and this as far as possible from the
very first day) a certain connection in the thoughts communicated
in the new language. Disconnected words are
but stones for bread; one cannot say anything sensible
with mere lists of words. Indeed not even disconnected
sentences ought to be used, at all events, not in such a
manner and to such an extent as in most books according
to the old method. For there is generally just as little
connexion between them as there would be in a newspaper
if the same line were read all the way across from column
to column. I shall take a few specimens at random from a
French reader that is much used: “My aunt is my
mother’s friend. My dear friend, you are speaking too
rapidly. That is a good book. We are too old. This
gentleman is quite sad. The boy has drowned many dogs.”
When people say that instruction in languages ought to be
a kind of mental gymnastics, I do not know if one of the
things they have in mind is such sudden and violent leaps
from one range of ideas to another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>In another French schoolbook we find: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous
sommes à Paris, vous êtes à Londres. Louise et Amélie,
où êtes-vous? Nous avons trouvé la lettre sur la table.
Avez-vous pris le livre? Avons-nous été à Berlin?
Amélie, vous êtes triste. Louis, avez-vous vu Philippe?
Sommes-nous à Londres?</span>”</p>

<p>The speakers seem to have a strange sense of locality.
First, they say that they themselves are in Paris, but the
one (the ones?) that they are speaking with are in London
(conversation by telephone?); then they cannot remember
if they themselves have been in Berlin; and at last they
ask if they themselves are in London. Unfortunately,
they get no answer, for the next sentence is, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre, vous
avez pris la canne.</span>”</p>

<p>Or take some of the books which are supposed to help
Danes learn English. They are no better. In one (which
appeared in 1889) we find: “The joiner has made this
chair. What a fine sunshine! For whom do you make
this bed? Which of you will have this box? I should
like to have it. Of whom have you got this cake? I am
very fond of cakes. I have borrowed a great deal of books
from a public library.”</p>

<p>From a “practical” primer in English, which appeared
in its second edition in 1893, I take the following specimens:
“Are the king’s horses very old? No; but the
duke’s carriage is old. Is it older than your friend’s?...
Has the nobleman told you the news? No, sir; but the
lady has told me the news about the business and the
wedding. Why do you not give the negro a house? No,
sir; but I can tell you that the German has given each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the negroes a pretty little house. Has the lady a knife?
Yes, the lady has two knives. Why do you not give the
ladies the German’s keys to the church? The noblemen
have the German’s keys.”</p>

<p>I could give you almost any number of that kind of
specimens. The ones I have chosen are not even of the
very worst type, since there is (some sort of) meaning in
each sentence by itself. But what shall we say when, in a
German reader, to the question <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wo seid ihr?</i> we find the
answer, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wir sind nicht hier!</i> The author of that book also
seems to have had a very vivid imagination when it came
to the use of pluperfects. “Your book had not been large.
Had you been sensible? Your horse had been old.” We
ask ourselves in surprise, when did this wonderful horse then
cease to be old? But that kind of material information is
not given in the book; it stops at the sphinx-like remark:
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dein Pferd war alt gewesen.</i> Could it really have been that
kind of schoolbooks that the Danish writer, Sören
Kierkegaard, alluded to when he wrote that language had
been given to man, not in order to conceal his thoughts, as
Talleyrand asserted, but in order to conceal the fact that
he had no thoughts?</p>

<p>Now it must immediately be admitted that there may be
a big difference in the schoolbooks made, even according
to this single-sentence system. It never seems to have
occurred to the authors of some of them that there might
be a limit to the amount of rubbish that can be offered
children under the pretext of teaching them grammar.
Others again try to give sentences which are both sensible
and in accordance with a child’s natural range of ideas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
With respect to the latter principle, there has been steady
progress from the times when the sentences either were
moral rules of conduct and philosophical profundities, or
selections about Greek heroes, etc. But even in the best
modern books the exercises are often strangely disjointed
(cf., for instance, this exercise from one of the better
books: “My brother had not many lessons yesterday.
Where had you been? The weather had been fine for a
long time. This boy had only been in our house three or
four weeks. Has your uncle had many tulips this year?
How long had you had this frock?”), and even if they are
not so glaringly nonsensical as some others, yet their very
disconnectedness makes them bad enough.</p>

<p>It is easy enough, however, to find something to make
fun of in all such books. Let us then rather ask the
reason why this system has so long been dominant. Its
defenders will, of course, refer to the difficulties in all
connected reading exercises; even the simplest stories
contain so many grammatical forms, and so many words,
that the beginner would be overwhelmed and confused by
having them all thrown at him at once. There must be
gradual progress in difficulty, that is, the material for instruction
must be arranged in stages from very easy to more
and more difficult things, and this is supposed to be attainable
only by means of disconnected sentences. The principle
is sound, but it is unsound to put it into practice in such a
manner that other pedagogical principles which are just as
sound are neglected. Should pedagogy not also demand
some sense in what one treats the children to? But, as
we have seen, it is not always so easy to find the sense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
And should it not also be of some significance to attract
the interest of the pupils? Nothing seems hard to a
willing mind. That which is associated with pleasant
recollections has a firmer place in the memory than dry
stuff. But exercises where it alternates between the
Frenchman who has taken the Englishman’s hat and the
Englishman who has taken the Frenchman’s cane, or
where either Marie sees Louise’s dog or Peter sees Henry’s
horse&mdash;they cannot be anything but boring, even if they
give the pupils ever so gradual practice in the use of the
genitive. Grown persons can, of course, put up with a
little boredom, if they think they can attain anything
by it; but in their heart of hearts they find such
things killing, and so they are; yes, even killing for the
linguistic sense. Children can, of course, put up with
a good deal, too, when they have a teacher who can
win their respect and affection; they also put up
with many things only for the sake of getting good
marks, or when they are stimulated by other equally
unsound means. But still, it is better to avoid boring
them.</p>

<p>I suppose it is also of pedagogical importance for the
teaching to be correct. But here we have just one of
those points where we see what evil results may come of
the system of disconnected sentences: it is so extremely
easy for them to become stilted; indeed, even incorrect.
Some examples may be found in the exercise already cited
on p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>, where the sentence, “For whom do you make
this bed?” is not good English, at any rate, and where “a
great deal of books” is a bad blunder for “a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
books.” It is really easier to write a long connected piece
in a foreign language about something that one is interested
in than to construct merely eight disconnected sentences
for the illustration of a couple of grammatical rules, and
without using other words than those the pupils already
have had. As impossible, even if not positively incorrect,
I consider such sentences as the following, to which any one
can find many parallels:&mdash;“Tie. Do not tie. Fetch. Do not
fetch.... Give. Do not give.”... Judged as thoughts
they are unfinished or half-finished ideas. Judged as
language, they are also very problematical. Such questions,
as “Do I take?” require the necessary information as to
what and when. Such fragments of sentences are never
heard in real life.</p>

<p>Finally, sentences of this kind give the pupil quite an
erroneous notion of what language is on the whole, and of
the relation between different languages. He is too apt to
get the impression that language means a collection of words
which are isolated and independent, and that there must be
a corresponding word in his native tongue for each new
foreign word that he learns. These words are then shoved
about without any real purpose according to certain given
rules, somewhat after the manner of a puzzle that was
popular some years ago. The mistake thus made is by
Sweet called the arithmetical fallacy, because languages are
taken as collections of units where the order of the addends
and the factors is immaterial. Everything that is idiomatic
in the languages is quite set aside, at all events for the time
being, without consideration for the fact that the most
indispensable expressions often are those irrational groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which cannot be constructed merely of words and grammatical
rules, expressions like “What’s the matter? I
couldn’t help laughing. Serve you right. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ça va sans dire.
Ça y est. Voilà qui est drôle.</span> <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie spät haben Sie?
Wer ist jetzt an der Reihe? Sie sind dran. Was ist denn
los?</span>” Where the Englishman circumstantially says “ring
the bell,” the Frenchman has the short “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sonnez</span>,” etc., etc.
When the pupil does not get a good deal of that kind of
thing as soon as possible, but for years continues translating
word-groups of the arithmetical kind until he is well
drilled in all the rules of the grammar, the result is that
when he is left to his own resources he takes each word of
the English phrase that happens to occur to him and translates
it literally into the language which he is trying to
speak.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That is how we come to hear such ridiculous
things as “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich konnte nicht helfen zu lachen.</span>”</p>

<p>It is grammar that plays the chief rôle. A characteristic
teacher’s report is: “In the course of the school-year we
have gone through accidence as far as the third class of
verbs.” The raison d’être of each sentence lies merely in
its value for the grammatical exercises, so that by reading
schoolbooks one often gets the impression that Frenchmen
must be strictly systematical beings, who one day speak
merely in futures, another day in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé définis</span>, and who
say the most disconnected things only for the sake of being
able to use all the persons in the tense which for the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
being happens to be the subject for conversation, while they
carefully postpone the use of the subjunctive until next
year.</p>

<p>Now, as misfortune will have it, although the whole
system is planned for drilling in grammar, this end is by
no means attained by these too systematical exercises.
The pupils get the scent of what is to be used in a certain
exercise, and they use it mechanically there, but they do
not learn how to transfer it to other connexions, so if they
suddenly have to use a future in an exercise on the pluperfect
the future form is apt to bear a suspicious resemblance
to the pluperfect form; when the pupils are being drilled
in the endings of the fourth declension, and a word belonging
to the third declension happens to have crept in, it is
very difficult to get it correctly declined without any
reminiscence of fourth-class endings, etc. I once read a
pedagogical article by a German schoolmaster, I think it
was, who had discovered that the reason why there were so
many poor Latin exercises written was that the pupils often
had to apply several rules of syntax in one and the same
sentence; if the sentences were only so made that each one
of them contained but one grammatical phenomenon, it
would soon be seen how clever the pupils could be.
Yes, how pleasant it would be if life too could be so
arranged as to have the difficulties come one at a time.</p>

<p>As previously remarked, there is too little attention paid
to what is idiomatical, and sentences constructed by non-natives
are apt to be of the kind that never would occur to
a native, even if it may be difficult enough to find positive
“mistakes” in them. Many of the French and German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
sentences in our schoolbooks must surely have the same
air of unreality for a native as not a few of those found in
English primers published abroad have for an Englishman.</p>

<p>Very closely connected with the idiomatical elements of
a language are its characteristics of style, and in this
respect too our schoolbooks are clumsy enough, for words
which belong merely to elevated or specially poetical style
are bundled together with every-day words in the very
beginning of the first primer without any caution to the
pupil against using them. A foreigner who wants to learn
English has first of all use for words like “grief, sorrow,”
but he had better postpone acquaintance with “woe,”
otherwise he is as likely as not to make himself ridiculous
by saying “it was a great woe to me.” “Unwilling” is
more necessary than “loth,” “wash” than “lave,”
“lonely” or “forsaken” than “forlorn,” etc. But on
one of the very first pages of Listov’s English Reader
which is written for beginners, we find “I bid him go,”
which is altogether old-fashioned, stiff and bookish (for: I
told him to go, I asked him to go, or I ordered ...), and
in the same book “foe” is preferred to the ordinary, indispensable
“enemy.” And in several English primers the
unnatural “commence” is used all the way through instead
of the natural “begin”; likewise the rare “purchase” for
the everyday “buy”&mdash;the only reason which I can think of
is that the ordinary, indispensable words follow irregular
declensions and inflexions.</p>

<p>The beginner has only use for the most everyday words; he
ought to have nothing to do with the vocabulary of poetry
or even of more elevated prose; like everything superfluous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it is detrimental, because it burdens the memory and
hinders perfect familiarity with that which is most necessary.
It will, moreover, be impossible for him to get a proper conception
of the linguistic effectiveness of poetry and elevated
prose, when he is so far advanced as to read the good
writers, because from his very first lesson in the language he
has learned the literary expressions side by side with the
phrases of normal prose and everyday conversation. But
even among words not belonging to the language of literature,
many may without scruple be postponed in order to
make room for the most necessary words, which must be
learned in such a manner that one always may have them
on hand without the slightest hesitation. In Miss Goldschmidt’s
picture-method (which is now used a good deal
outside of its native land, Denmark, and also in large
part deserves the popularity and praise which it has
won), I find, for instance, not less than 58 words for
that many more or less intimate articles of women’s
clothing; and when I in the same book under the heading
“cuisine” find 46 words, among others, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouilloire
tamis, passoire, pelle à main, puisoire, lavette, canelle
évier, coquetier, écumoire, entonnoir, pilon, râtelier, râpe,
billot, manne</span>,” I cannot help feeling thankful that no one
ever tormented me with learning them; it seems to me I
have got along pretty well in Paris and elsewhere in French
conversations, just as I have read many French books,
without knowing all these technical words. But, on the
other hand, I have a strong notion that I should not
have got along so well in conversation, and should not
have been able to read French so well, if my vocabulary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
had been limited to the one in Miss Goldschmidt’s pictures.</p>

<p>The usual treatment of grammar, too, involves the learning
of a number of words that one has no use for. There
are few words which even the stupidest pupils in French
and English have so pat as “louse,” and the reason is that
the plural of both “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pou</span>” and “louse” happens to be
something out of the ordinary. For as soon as a word is
declined differently from the usual paradigms, it has to be
learned for the sake of so-called completeness. Thus we
had to learn in school the rigmarole: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">amussis, ravis,
sitis, tussis, vis</span>” and usually also “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">febris, pelvis, puppis,
restis, turris, securis</span>,” where “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis vim</span>” (perhaps also
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sitis sitim</span>”) would have sufficed; the others (with
meanings like ruler, hoarseness, rope), I am sure, never
occurred in what we read of Latin literature, and as far as
the last words are concerned, why it would not have made
any difference anyway if we had let the accusative end in
“&mdash;em,” if we had to use the word in a catch exercise. And
then there was the “long rigmarole” which it was our
pride to be able to run through without winking: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">amnis,
axis</span>,” etc., and which doubtless has cost us all some hours
of drudgery before we could quite make it stick. Of the
words in it, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrobis, sentis, torris, vectis</span>,” at least, were
entirely superfluous for us&mdash;aside from the fact that if by
some wonderful chance we should come across one of the
words in the course of our reading, we were sure enough
to remember that the word stood in the long rigmarole, but
why it stood there or what the word meant, that was apt to
be quite forgotten. Well, it did not make much difference
in so far as the chances were a thousand to one that for un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>derstanding
the passage in question it was absolutely of no
consequence if we had remembered that the word was
masculine. (It may be of some comfort to add that some
of them may also be feminine: the old Romans were not
always as big pedants as Latin teachers would like to make
them out to be.) Sweet writes: “In the German grammar
I began with the word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hornung</i>, ‘February,’ was given as an
exception to the rule that nouns in <i>-ung</i> are feminine, and
for many years no German word was more familiar to me,
except perhaps <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">petschaft</i>, ‘seal,’ whose acquaintance I made
at the same time and in the same way. But to the present
day I cannot remember having met with either of them in
any modern German book, still less of ever having heard
them in conversation, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hornung</i> being now entirely obsolete
except in some German dialects. At last, when I began
Middle High Grammar, I met with it for the first time in
my life in a poem of Walther von der Vogelweide, but by
this time I had forgotten all about it.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In most English grammars for foreigners, the word
<i>caiman</i> plays such an important part that the children never
can forget it, and this is just because it is not <i>caimen</i> in
the plural; likewise it is carefully inculcated on the pupils
that <i>die</i> meaning “a stamp used for coining money” has
the plural <i>dies</i>, but it is scarcely probable that one in a
thousand will ever have any use for the word in this sense;
cf. Storm’s remark on <i>travail</i> quoted below.</p>

<p>Much of that kind of thing has fortunately been removed
from the schoolbooks of later years, but there is no doubt
still some weeding to be done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>


<p>On the basis of the above negative criticism, we may
perhaps formulate the following positive requirements for
those reading selections which are to be the foundation
for instruction in languages, namely that as far as possible
they must</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) be connected, with a sensible meaning,</p>

<p>(2) be interesting, lively, varied,</p>

<p>(3) contain the most necessary material of the
language first, especially the material of everyday
language,</p>

<p>(4) be correct French (German, etc.),</p>

<p>(5) pass gradually from that which is easy to that
which is more difficult,</p>

<p>(6) yet without too much consideration for what is
merely grammatically easy or difficult.</p></div>

<p>This order does not indicate the relative importance or
value of the requirements, which might be difficult to determine.
If there should be any disagreement between them,
I suppose it is generally best to try to find some practical
compromise. We must now pass on to examine some of
these requirements more closely.</p>

<p>The use of <em>connected</em> texts in the elementary teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
languages has already previously been tried, but it seems
as if in the effort to avoid the Scylla of disconnected
sentences it has been impossible to escape the Charybdis of
such texts as Chateaubriand’s <cite>Atala</cite>, Dickens’ <cite>Christmas
Carol</cite> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode</span> Toussaint-Langenscheidt), the New
Testament, or Cæsar’s <cite>Gallic War</cite>, etc. How often after
such experiments, when the pupil was overwhelmed and did
not learn anything because he was to learn everything at
once, has not the teacher returned in despair to the disconnected
sentences.</p>

<p>But between the two extremes there is no doubt room
for the golden mean of beginning with quite short
connected pieces, and then gradually, as each lesson may
be lengthened, passing over to longer texts&mdash;of course this
does not necessarily mean that a whole piece must always
be taken for each lesson; the breaks in the lessons do not
need to correspond to the breaks in the text-book.</p>

<p>Anecdotes meet the requirements in so far as they are
short connected pieces, and therefore they play such an
important part in many readers. But yet they are not
quite the thing, especially when they are used in too great
numbers. A pointed anecdote can only be really funny
once; if it is to be repeated many times, it soon becomes
stale and indeed more tiresome than most other things.
And just the very quality which makes it amusing makes
it less valuable for teaching purposes; that is, an anecdote
must by its very nature contain as few words as possible;
but it is better for beginners to get a little broader colouring,
so that the most necessary words and phrases may
recur frequently. If many anecdotes follow one upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
other, it is not easy to avoid frequent jumps between totally
different spheres of thought and accordingly between totally
different worlds of words; this increases the difficulty, and
the result is apt to be that words and expressions once
learned are soon forgotten. Anecdotes depending upon
puns cannot be appreciated at all without full familiarity
with the words resembling each other, and that can only
in a minority of cases be assumed for our pupils. The
best way to use anecdotes in teaching languages is to let
them serve as spice in or in connection with other pieces,
especially descriptive pieces, so that the words used in the
anecdotes may there appear in their natural surroundings.
This can best be done in short stories about animals; in
my own books for beginners in English, I have taken
several such pieces from purely scientific works by Sir
John Lubbock, Romanes, Tylor, etc. I mention these as
examples of a kind of texts which seem to me to be
especially attractive (but which are neither so easy to get
hold of nor to concoct), because they give entertaining
and sensible information about things which are often
neglected in the natural science instruction itself, and
at the same time they give an opportunity of learning a
good deal of useful language-material without being too
difficult. The pieces which are merely descriptive of
nature, and which Sweet lays so much stress upon, have the
advantage that they in a still greater degree allow of the
employment of the most indispensable material of language,
and that a number of the sentences may be made self-explanatory
(<i>v.</i> below). There are, however, but relatively
few subjects that can be dealt with in this way&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
most elementary natural phenomena&mdash;and when they are
not written in such a masterly manner as in Sweet’s
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch</cite>, there are apt to
be so many well-known truths told in these pieces that
the interest flags.</p>

<p>In deciding on what will be of interest as a selection for
reading, differences in age must of course to a great extent
be taken into consideration. But it is an experience which
I myself have had, and in which many teachers bear me
out, that beginners in a foreign language may very well be
interested in certain reading matter even if they are
beyond the age when corresponding things would interest
them in their native language. So one must not be afraid
of childish texts; but by this I do not mean to recommend
a certain kind of juvenile literature which flourishes in all
countries, and which aunts, especially the unmarried ones,
often think that children appreciate, and so they themselves
also proceed to produce it in large quantities, that is, milk-and-water
stories and verses about the reward of good
children and the frightful punishment of the naughty ones;
both young and old find such “literature” nauseating, and
it were best to avoid it in text-books in foreign languages.
But there is another class of literature, that collected by
folklorists, which is orally transmitted from generation to
generation, and which shows its vigour by being continually
amusing and by continually shooting new shoots.
Much of it can successfully be used in teaching
languages; and that which amuses a French child of
five or six years may often amuse an English child
of ten or eleven or even more, because in the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
language it gets the charm that always is connected with
the unknown.</p>

<p>Much of this material&mdash;and of other material, which,
without belonging to popular tradition, is related to it&mdash;is in
verse-form, which has the great advantage for our purpose,
that rhythm and rhyme naturally rivet the words and expressions
fast to each other, so that the memory gets hold of
them like an unbreakable chain. It is only with great
difficulty and with much repetition that prose sentences can
be inculcated in a certain given form; but to learn verse is
like play&mdash;it learns itself. If therefore the poetry of art,
with its more or less unnatural language, is unsuitable for
the beginner, the little witty natural verses of the genuine
children’s literature are, on the other hand, excellent. But
of course not even these are always pure pearls, and there
are many of them to be rejected as containing impertinences,
nonsense-words, fragments of antiquated language,
or words which beginners have no use for; it seems to me,
for instance, that Viëtor and Dörr should not have transferred
the nursery rhymes wholesale (even the old forms
with <i>&mdash;th</i> in the third person, and much more) into their
otherwise excellent English reader.</p>

<p>With respect to the requirement that the reading must
be <em>easy</em>&mdash;or rather that there must be gradual progress from
easy to difficult&mdash;it must be recognized that difficulty may
depend upon several different things.</p>

<p>In the first place, the subject-matter may be too difficult;
it ought never to be beyond the horizon of the pupils. As
previously remarked, in the very beginning, one may even
take something simpler than what would otherwise be suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>able
for persons of that age. But later, on the other hand,
the subject-matter ought not to be too light; it is well, as
soon as possible, to use matter which really has a permanent
value of its own. A large part of the reading will no
doubt always be taken from lighter literature, and most of
it will not cause any real difficulty as far as the comprehension
of the subject-matter is concerned. But in addition
to that, there ought surely to be read to a far greater extent
than has hitherto been the case in modern language instruction,
matter which cannot be understood without some
serious thinking, articles on natural science and on human
relations in the widest sense of the word, political speeches,
etc. Many teachers seem to be afraid to read anything
else with their pupils than the most insignificant novel-literature
whose contents furnish starvation food. A little
friend of mine seven years old once said to his mother:
“I like that best which I can scarcely understand.” He
thereby expressed the same thought as Dante when he said
that man is not happy unless he strains every nerve, or
Stuart Mill in his remark: “A pupil who is never required
to do what he cannot do never does what he can do.”
All instruction must spur the pupil on with problems that
are not too easy; in the first stage of instruction in
languages, there are problems enough in the purely
linguistic difficulties; later on the contents of the reading,
too, ought to require some independent powers of assimilation.
Sometimes it may even be best to choose selections
where the language is very easy, but the matter rather
weighty&mdash;especially in teaching according to the reform-method,
where subject-matter is necessarily assigned a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
important part than hitherto, and where even an easy text
can in various ways be advantageously employed as a means
of training in purely linguistic skill.</p>

<p>Even linguistic easiness or difficulty may depend upon
different things. Difficulties in pronunciation ought not
to be piled up, a caution applying especially to selections
for the very first beginners. Some teachers try to begin
with words which may be almost or wholly pronounced
with sounds occurring in the native language of the pupils.
Aside from the fact that in most cases it only leads to disappointment
to exaggerate the resemblance between the
foreign and native sounds, this principle may easily lead to
slovenliness at a stage when it might involve the most
dangerous consequences. The pupil ought from the very
first lesson to have the clearest sensation of being on
foreign ground, and he ought to realize that the foreign
sounds cannot be learned without work. But the difficult
sounds ought not to occur too many in succession or in too
difficult combinations. It is perhaps best to begin with
words of one syllable, but this need not be strictly carried
through. I do not, however, attach so much importance to
mere difficulties in pronunciation that I would advise an
otherwise suitable opening selection in a French reader
for beginners to be discarded because it contained such
difficult words as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manger</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chien</i>. It cannot be long,
anyway, before the pupils must make acquaintance with,
and, what is more, master all the sounds in the language
they are about to learn. By difficulties in pronunciation
here I mean the real ones, and not such apparent difficulties
as are due to freaks of orthography; it is equally troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for a German to pronounce English <i>pear</i> and <i>pair</i>; such
difficulties as are found in English <i>scarce</i>, <i>fatigue</i>, <i>victuals</i>,
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eut</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pupille</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pitié</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balbutier</i>, etc., may be overcome
by a panacea which I shall come to later, namely, phonetical
transcription.</p>

<p>Furthermore linguistic difficulty may be due to the use
of too many new words, and in this respect the best principle
at all stages is: as few new words as possible. Every
one who has read such pages as often occur in Zola or
Daudet, where technical expressions are abundantly piled
up, will have had the experience that even with the most
careful reading or study it did not take long before all the
new words were just as unfamiliar as before the selection
was read. Likewise, when one sets to work to learn systematic
vocabularies like Plötz’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vocabulaire Systématique</cite>,
it requires enormous exertion and a long time to learn
them, and it takes an amazingly short time to unlearn them
again. But if, in the course of one’s reading, the new words
turn up occasionally at relatively large intervals, then the
mind is able to absorb the one before the next appears;
the intervening passages, which contain only familiar things,
manure the soil, as it were, for the new things that are to
be sown in it. Ten or twelve new words are more easily
and more thoroughly learned when they are scattered over
five pages than when they are crowded into ten lines, and
then besides there is the benefit to be derived from the recurrence
of a number of usual words, to say nothing of
sentence-constructions, etc., so that he who has read those
five pages has had more opportunity to familiarize himself
with the idiosyncrasies of the foreign language than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
would have had in ten lines; the apparent waste of time in
reading the longer piece has really been profitable, for the
capital which had already been acquired in the language
has in that time borne interest and compound interest.</p>

<p>Now since it is also better, as we have said, to learn five
absolutely necessary words than twenty-five of less importance,
it is of course the duty of the editors of text-books in
large part to revise the selections which they reprint, so
that that which is of linguistic value for the pupils may be
cultivated at the expense of everything that is unusual or
odd. Texts whose subject-matter is good, but whose
language makes them impossible for our purpose, may often
be made pedagogically practicable by means of curtailing,
paraphrasing, and adaptation in various ways; many popular
fairy-tales in the collections of folklorists may be used
if one only will take the trouble to translate them from the
dialect in which they are written. Such a splendid little
story as Mrs. Ewing’s <cite>Jackanapes</cite>, which is frequently read
as it stands in German and Swedish schools, is, according
to my judgment, too full of literary expressions and unnecessary
words to be easily comprehended by our little
pupils. In the passage which I have selected for my own
primer, I have therefore in several places made considerable
omissions, and the style has throughout been made more
colloquial and direct, by means of corrections like these for
instance: having <em>ceased to entertain</em> (given up) any hopes
of his own recovery. | Tony tumbled off <em>during the first
revolution</em> (before he had gone round once). | And what
bright eyes <em>peeped out of his dark forelock as it was blown
by the wind</em>! (he had!) | told him that he must <em>be on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
very best behaviour</em> (behave properly) during the visit. If it
had been <em>feasible</em> (possible) to leave off calling him Jackanapes
and to get used to his <em>baptismal</em> (real Christian)
name of Theodore before the day after to-morrow <em>it would
have been satisfactory</em> (she would have done it) | said J.,
shaking his yellow <em>mop</em> (hair), and leaning back in his <em>one
of the two Chippendale</em> armchairs <em>in which they sat</em> (the
italicized words left out) | <em>took their early promenade</em> (went
out for their walk) earlier than usual | His golden hair flew
out, <em>an aureole from which his cheeks shone red and distended
with trumpeting</em> (left out). It is very probable that on
comparing the original with the revised text, it will be
found that some of the colouring has been lost; I merely
maintain that the pupils gain thereby. The more it is
insisted upon (as according to the reform-method) that the
selections are not only to be read but also to be mastered,
so that their language becomes the mental property of the
pupil, the more necessary is such revision. It is clear that
as the pupil progresses, the texts may become more and
more literary, and for various reasons the advisability of
such curtailing and adaptation becomes more questionable.</p>

<p>As a sample of such revision, I shall reprint a part of an
anecdote, (A) as it ought not to be given in a book for beginners
(but as it stands in a certain English reader for
foreigners) and (B) as it stands in Sweet’s excellent
edition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>A</i>) His table, however, is constantly set out with a
dozen covers, and served by suitable attendants.
Who, then, are his privileged guests? No less
than a dozen of favourite dogs, who daily par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>take
of my lord’s dinner, seated very gravely in
armchairs, each with a napkin round his neck,
and a servant behind to attend to his wants.
These honourable quadrupeds, as if grateful for
such delicate attentions, comport themselves
during the repast with a decency which would do
more than honour to a party of gentlemen; but
if by any chance one of them should, without due
consideration, obey his natural instinct, and transgress
any of the rules of good manners, his
punishment is at hand.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>) Every day he used to have dinner laid for twelve
guests besides himself; but no one was ever
invited to the house. Who were the twelve
covers laid for then, do you think? For twelve
dogs. Each dog had a velvet chair to sit up in,
and a napkin round his neck, and a footman
behind his chair to wait on him. The older dogs
always behaved in the most gentlemanly manner,
but it sometimes happened that one of the
younger dogs forgot his manners, and snatched a
chop or a piece of pudding off the plate of the
dog that was sitting next to him.</p></div>

<p>Finally the difficulties may be grammatical. These are
the difficulties that teachers have been most afraid of
according to the old methods, so that they have even preferred
to give up almost all sense and connection in the
subject-matter rather than make a break in the systematical
progress in grammar. Such a form as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pu</i> was not
allowed to occur before the pupils had learned the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
conjugation of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouvoir</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouvant</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pu</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je peux</i>, etc.; these
forms must be learned connectedly, it was said. But the
irony of it all is that this “connectedly” means that they
are learned out of all connection&mdash;and therefore to little
profit. When the pupil is required to “understand”
the forms which occur in his reader, it will be found on
closer examination that this means merely that, for instance,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il a</i> is understood by the one who knows that it is 3
pers. sing. pres. of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avoir</i>, or who at least knows the formula
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">j’ai</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu as</i>, etc.; that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">yeux</i> is “understood” by the one who
has learned that it is an irregular plural belonging to the
singular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">œil</i>, etc.; in short, to “understand” means here
to know where the form in question belongs in the grammatical
system; and the forms must be given in exactly
the same order in which they are arranged in the grammar,
the present before the past tense, etc. But what has the
beginner got to do with all this system? The idea is not
carried out consistently either, for when all the exercises on
accidence have been gone through, it is generally the rule
to pass over to connected (unrevised) texts, where such a
form as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">puisse</i> may occur, but the only thing that the pupils
get to know about it is that it is subjunctive, for it may easily
take a year or two before they learn why the subjunctive is
used. Why is syntax less important than accidence? To be
quite consistent, it ought no more to be permissible for a
syntactical phenomenon than for a form in accidence to
occur before the corresponding grammatical section has
been learned. But since it seems to be inevitable that
we must be inconsistent on some point or other, it is no
use beating about the bush; in other words, we must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
be afraid of using irregular forms in the very first selection.</p>

<p>Grammatical irregularities, viewed from a pedagogical
point of view, fall into two entirely different classes, which
are too apt to be treated as if they were co-ordinate. In
the first place, all languages contain a number of irregularities
which play a most insignificant part both in life and
in literature, because they occur so seldom. When the
users of the language produce them at long intervals, it is
generally with the utmost caution, because they merely
have a hazy conception of what the proper form of the
expressions ought to be. But they are taken up in the
grammars, and as soon as one grammarian has caught
sight of one of them, it is carefully copied in all succeeding
grammars for the sake of completeness. Foreign grammarians
are even more inclined than the natives to pay
attention to everything of that kind because they have no
instinctive feeling of what is rare and what is common.
In some English grammars which are used on the Continent,
there may still be found <i>I catched</i>, <i>I digged</i>, <i>I shined</i>,
<i>I writ</i>, as the preterite forms of <i>I catch</i>, <i>I dig</i>, <i>I shine</i>,
<i>I write</i>; in one, I find given as two different verbs <i>I
weet</i>, <i>wit</i> or <i>wot</i>, past tense <i>wot</i>, and <i>I wis</i>, past tense
<i>I wist</i>. What a big mistake it is to include such musty
and impracticable forms, we can best judge from our own
language&mdash;but in those French and German grammars
which we ourselves write there are things which are just as
bad as the above offences in English. When I went to
school, I learned the following rule about the plural of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travail</i>, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Travail</i> has <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travails</i> in the plural when it means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a report from a minister to the king or from a subordinate
official to the minister; likewise when it means a machine
to hold unruly horses, while they are being shoed.” This
rule is thus criticized by Storm: “Now I must say I have
read many hundreds of French books in my day, but so
far as I remember, I have never come across <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travails</i> in
modern literature! In the sense of report, it occurs in
Mme. de Sévigné. An educated Frenchman, when asked
if the word was used with that meaning, answered me that
he thought it was no longer used. So one would expect
that the word had long ago ceased to have any show in
modern grammars, but it seems to be continually creeping
in again.”</p>

<p>However, it is easy enough to take a position with respect
to this first kind of irregularities; they ought to be removed
from the instruction as radically as possible; they ought to
be weeded out root and all to a far greater extent than has
yet been done in most text-books, even if it must be
admitted that something has been done in this direction of
late years. It is quite another matter when we come to the
other kind of irregularities, which are found in the very
commonest words, in words like German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ist</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">war</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kann</i>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">konnte</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">geht</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ging</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ich</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mann</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">männer</i>. Those irregularities
the pupil must learn, and learn thoroughly&mdash;there
is no doubt about that. The only question is, at what
stage? before or after the regular inflections? Most
teachers will answer, after. That a systematic grammar
first gives what is normal, that which can be expressed in
general, comprehensive rules, and then afterwards mentions
the exceptions, the isolated phenomena, that of course is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
right. But it does not necessarily follow that the pupils
ought to familiarize themselves with the forms in the same
order. What is won thereby? Perhaps some advantage
for the theoretical knowledge about the language. But the
loss incurred by this method of procedure is undoubtedly
far greater. For it will be found to be absolutely impossible
to arrange texts which are the least bit suitable without
using irregularly inflected words, so indispensable are they.
The dread of being unsystematic by taking up exceptions
immediately is one of the causes of the prevalence of the
disheartening series of detached sentences without any
sensible meaning. It is only by freeing ourselves from
this principle which requires rules first and exceptions later
that we shall be able to get good texts for the teaching of
beginners. Furthermore, by beginning with the regular
forms, we perhaps run the risk that the pupils will analogically
apply the rule even to the exceptional words, whereas
the irregular forms generally deviate so much that they
preclude the possibility of such mistakes. Those who have
learned that the plural in English is formed by adding <i>s</i>,
may perhaps construct such improper forms as <i>mans</i>, <i>childs</i>,
but the plural forms <i>men</i> and <i>children</i> are not apt to tempt
the pupils to inflect other words after the same pattern.
But the moral of this is not that we are to turn the
customary method of procedure upside down, and systematically
learn the exceptions first. Here, too, nature must
be our guide; just as persons talking within a child’s
hearing never stop to consider if the words they are using
are regular or not, so we ought not to be too painfully
careful in selecting or arranging the first reading-exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in a foreign language; we ought to choose what is otherwise
good and take the forms as they come, wasting no
words at this stage to explain their place in the system.
In other words, the deviating forms must be learned as if
they were merely matters of vocabulary. If in one of the
first pieces there stands <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y avait une fois un roi et une reine</i>,
it is enough for the time being if the pupil is told that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il y
avait</i> = there was; the forms for “there is” and “there has
been” he can learn another time when he has use for them,
and then the teacher can refer back to this early piece and
remind the pupil about the related form which he learned
before. For beginners in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peux</i>&mdash;“can” is just as
difficult (or easy) as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peu</i>&mdash;“little,” and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire</i>&mdash;“make, do,”
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fer</i>&mdash;“iron,” and it makes no difference if the one is
regular and the other irregular. Indeed, an irregular
plural like <i>geese</i> is even easier for Danes than the regular
<i>bees</i> (on account of the z-sound); likewise, it is easier for
an Englishman to learn the German irregular forms of
comparison <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">besser</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">best</i> than regular forms like <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">süsser</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">süssest</i>.
Later when the time has come for a more systematic study
of the grammar, it will be rather an advantage that a
number of the “exceptions” already have occurred at so
early a stage that they are not at all felt to be strange and
unusual.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the beginner ought to be spared such
grammatical difficulties as are due to complicated sentence-structure.
All sentences ought from the very beginning to
be constructed as evenly, simply and clearly as possible;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
co-ordinate independent clauses ought to be, if not the
only, at least the predominating type of sentence. Not
even, for instance, in the second year of Latin instruction,
although there are just as many hours devoted to Latin in
a year as generally fall to the share of modern languages in
the course of two or three years, is it justifiable to let the
pupils read the long passages of indirect discourse in Cæsar;
they ought not to occur until the pupils are so far advanced
that they could easily understand the same matter when
directly presented. This is also a point to be kept in mind
for any one who undertakes to revise the selections for
reading according to the suggestions given above.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>


<p>So much for the reading selections&mdash;now for the way in
which they ought to be used in the classroom. I have a
very vivid recollection of how most of the language lessons
were conducted when I went to school, and I have a
suspicion that this method of procedure has not yet quite
died out, even if in many places it has more or less felt the
influence of the law of change. First the “old lesson” is
gone through, and that must take as little time as possible,
therefore the pupil is required to be able to translate it
fluently without reading it aloud first. Then we come to
the “new lesson.” A boy stands up and reads a little piece
out of the reader&mdash;stuttering; the words are separated
from each other by pauses and various unaesthetic hm-
and er- sounds, and sometimes by the teacher’s corrections,
or “now hurry,” “what a terrible pronunciation!” “how
do you pronounce g before e? well, you know that just as
well as I do, you blockhead,” etc. All that the boy thinks
about, whenever he gets an opportunity, is, what in the
world can be the meaning of that word I am coming to.
Then he translates, interrupted by the teacher’s corrections,
or “look out,” “where is the verb,” “but what case is it,”
etc. Then there are, perhaps, some grammatical questions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he is to give the principal parts of a verb or two, explain
the use of a subjunctive, etc.; the questions are not asked
in the foreign language and are not to be answered in that
tongue. The next boy is called upon to recite in the same
way, and so on until the lesson has been gone through; if
there is time enough, perhaps we go through it once more,
but that must be in a hurry, so we do not stop to read it first
this time. The last five or six minutes are devoted to looking
through the lesson for next time; the teacher translates
it while the pupils follow it in their books, and perhaps exert
themselves to write down the meaning of some difficult
word in the margin of the reader or in a note-book.</p>

<p>The most prominent feature of the teaching is haste;
there is much to be done, especially as examination draws
on. It seems to be an established custom that the examination
marks are determined by the quality of the translation,
and it is in order to get practice in translating that the
reading selections are gone through as many times as
possible. There is not much time for reading aloud; why,
when one has only learned the main principles of pronunciation,
one can generally infer the pronunciation of
any word from the spelling, especially in German, but also
in French. I suppose it is more or less in this confidence
that the teachers let a piece be translated three or four
times for every time it is read aloud in the original.</p>

<p>How much of the foreign language does the pupil hear
in the course of such a lesson? The teacher says a word
now and then&mdash;for instance, when a pupil translates incorrectly;
but then the attention is not directed to the
pronunciation; besides, it is generally only one word that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he says, and that word occurs most likely in a sentence in
the pupils’ own language. Now, it is a matter of fact that
even one who pronounces very well cannot get the proper
French swing of a French word when it occurs in company
with words of another language. The basis of articulation
is different in the two languages, and it is not easy to shift
from the one to the other in a moment. So it is but little
that the pupil hears from his teacher. From his classmates
he hears a little more, no doubt; but theirs is not exactly
exemplary pronunciation, and besides, it does not interest
him to pay attention to it. If he only can manage to
keep the place in the book where the others are for the
moment, he can very well think about other things while
the others are reciting; he can, for instance, review the difficult
words in the next piece, if he does not prefer to dream
about his stamp collection or his bicycle. Finally, on rare
occasions, he is permitted to read a couple of lines aloud in
class, but it is considered merely as a sort of introduction
to the main business in hand, translation. He never gets
an opportunity to say anything himself in the foreign
language outside of what stands in the book, and he very
seldom hears others say anything that he is not following
in print.</p>

<p>So it is no wonder that such instruction scarcely cultivates
at all the pupil’s ability to understand a foreign
language as it is rapidly and naturally spoken by a native.
If he should hear the simplest every-day sentence in a
foreign language, correctly and naturally pronounced, and
he should be asked merely to repeat it, he would in nine
cases out of ten betray the strangest perplexity, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he would have had no trouble whatever with a far more
difficult piece which he happened to meet with in print.</p>

<p>But that is not all; this method has other disadvantages.
The foreign words gallop past the pupil’s eye; his main
object is to be able to recognize them in a vague sort of
way so that they may give him the clue to the translation.
Oftentimes one word thus vaguely remembered even gives
him the clue to the translation of a whole sentence which
he knows by heart because there was something special
about it. What he gets hold of is the translation, and the
whole translation often comes to his mind when he has
only looked at the beginning of the sentence in the
original&mdash;sometimes, however, only on condition that it
stands in the same place on the page (at the top to the
left, etc.), where he is used to seeing it. There is not the
same inducement to remember the forms of the foreign
expressions exactly. If you take a clever boy who has
been taught according to the usual method and, after he
has translated a little piece of his lesson, close his book
and ask him to give the original of the last sentence which
he has translated, it will in many cases be impossible for
him to do it. I reported an example of this at the congress
in Stockholm in 1886; a clever pupil was translating
a piece of Mérimée’s <cite>Colomba</cite> at sight, and was doing it
very well, when I made the experiment. He apparently
remembered the sentence well enough in the translation,
but it was slowly and with difficulty that he ventured the
French: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et il pleurait comme le fils de Pietri pleurait.</i> But
in the book there stood: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et il pleura comme pleurait le
fils de Pietri.</i> It is clear that it is impossible for a pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to get a correct conception of the radical difference
between <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé défini</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imparfait</span>, or of the effect of the
order of words, when he pays so little attention to the
French forms that he meets with. One can never get any
real appreciation of the idiosyncrasies of a foreign language
as long as the translation is the main object.</p>

<p>Let us consider for a moment the workings of a boy’s
mind when it is his turn to recite and he has to translate
such a sentence as, for instance: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cet homme, dont elle ne
voyait jamais les enfants</i>. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cet</i>, this, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme</i>, man,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dont</i>, whose&mdash;now he discovers that it will not be
English if he continues to take one word after the other in
the French order, so he looks ahead, tries every word
hurriedly; finally he finds <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les enfants</i>, the children; no,
I forgot, we must not have the article there in English,
so merely children; back to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle</i>, she; now he sees that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne jamais</i> must be taken first: never; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyait</i>, saw. So
instead of taking the French words in the natural order,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, he has to skip backwards and forwards
in order to get them in the order 1, 2, 3, (8), 9, 4,
5, 7, 6. In an English text-book for German schools the
following sentence<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is given for translation with numbers
indicating the order in which the words are to be taken in
English:<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"> <sup>1</sup>Würden <sup>2</sup>Sie <sup>3</sup>nicht <sup>6</sup>viel <sup>7</sup>zeit <sup>5</sup>gehabt <sup>4</sup>haben
<sup>8</sup>wenn <sup>9</sup>Sie <sup>11</sup>nicht <sup>15</sup>jenen <sup>16</sup>brief <sup>13</sup>zu <sup>14</sup>schreiben
<sup>12</sup>gehabt <sup>10</sup>hätten.</span> In other cases, it is the pupils themselves
who by means of numbers and letters (“paving
letters”) smooth the difficulty of translation. Anyone
who is accustomed to translate German at sight knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
how when he has translated the subject of a dependent
clause he silently runs through what follows, often several
lines, in order to find the verb, which according to English
usage must not be too far separated from its subject, and
how in hastily trying each single word his attention is
drawn to a number of subordinate thoughts while the
main thought stands and waits, as it were. This mental
process is made even more complicated by the fact that
only in a minority of cases does every word in a sentence
(like the simple sentence given above) in any way correspond
to an English word; as a rule the translator also has
to think about such questions as, does <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sich</i> here mean him,
or her, or himself, or herself, or itself, or oneself; does <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si</i>
mean so, or as, or if; is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il fait</i> to be taken as he does, he
makes, he has (something done), or it does, or it is, or in still
another way, etc., etc. This mental process, which is
much more complicated than would generally be supposed,
is far beyond the ability of the children. Therefore
they often remain contented with the text-book’s, the
teacher’s or the parent’s translation, which is learned
partly or entirely by heart; otherwise the translation is apt
to swarm with the well-known offences against the mother-tongue,
word-formations, phrases, expressions, order of
words, etc., which are not English. Since the teacher of
course cannot put up with this murdering of the King’s
English, a large part of every lesson in the foreign language
has to be spent in the troublesome task of rooting out
these barbarisms.</p>

<p>That is why it is so often said that instruction in foreign
languages always is, or ought to be, at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
instruction in one’s native language, or, as the matter is
sometimes more pointedly put, that the main object in
learning other languages is to get a correct knowledge of
one’s own. Of course there is much truth in this last statement,
if it is the theoretical understanding of languages that
we are thinking about; for it is only natural that we cannot
appreciate the richness of our mother-tongue, or have any
opinion about its structural advantages or disadvantages, or
even give a correct description of its structure or understand
its historical development, when we have no other languages
to compare it with.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Yet all this ought not to
close our eyes to the fact that as soon as it is a
question of the practical command of the mother-tongue,
the assertion is utterly false. In this respect
instruction in foreign languages does not help us, and it is
not the people who are most accomplished in other languages
who are the best stylists in their own. On the
contrary! Only compare the language used by the same
pupil in his English essays and in his translations from the
Latin; in the latter, you will find a number of offences
against good English usage which could not possibly have
occurred in the former. So the errors are in reality not due
to a deficient command of the mother-tongue, but solely
and alone to the restraining and confusing influence
brought to bear upon the pupil’s thoughts by the foreign
forms of expression; the strange language lures him in
upon linguistic paths where he would never set his foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
otherwise, and which only lead him into a mire. It is the
school with its translation-method that has sown the
dragon’s teeth, and it must now reap the consequences.
Instruction in foreign languages, according to the prevailing
method, is so far from being a help to the pupils in their
treatment of English, that, on the contrary, in spite of all
the energy which is put in on combating Germanisms,
Latinisms, etc., in the translations, it often makes them
uncertain and vacillating in their feeling for what is good
English.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The acquirement of a certain intuition for good usage in
a <em>foreign</em> language had best be left out of the discussion
here; a really thorough knowledge of French or German
habits of expression is, of course, not to be obtained as
long as we are unable to see anything in these languages
without straightway turning all our attention to something
quite different, namely, the English rendering.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We get no
further than to a “nodding acquaintance” with the component
parts of the foreign language, so that we know them
pretty well by sight and can repeat their names, but we
do not become quite intimate with them, we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
live together with them, they do not become flesh of our
flesh and blood of our blood. If something difficult is to
be learned, the very first essential is to be much occupied
with it; therefore the first condition for good instruction in
foreign languages would seem to be to give the pupil as
much as possible to do with and in the foreign language;
he must be steeped in it, not only get a sprinkling of it now
and then; he must be ducked down in it and get to feel as
if he were in his own element, so that he may at last
disport himself in it as an able swimmer. But what is most
characteristic for the prevailing methods is that the translation
with its accessories swallows up so much time, that
there is none left for this free disporting in the foreign
element.</p>

<p>Then why does translation play such an important part?
We must first find an answer to this question before we
proceed to ask if it can and ought to be thrust into the
background, and by what means. Now the ability to
translate may either be considered the end of instruction in
foreign languages, or translation may be regarded merely as
a means of instruction (one of several means or perhaps the
only means).</p>

<p>Now is it right to say that the <em>purpose</em> of instruction in a
foreign language is that the pupils may learn to <em>translate</em>
fluently and exactly (from and into the language)? The
answer must be an emphatic No. The popular opinion
among those who have not thought the matter over, or who
have not given sufficiently careful attention to their own
mental processes, is that a foreign language can be understood
only by transposing it into one’s mother-tongue; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this is not so. Those who read foreign authors in the
original with real advantage do not actually first translate
each word, still less each sentence or each period, into
English before they proceed further. Those who are
listening to a French lecture or seeing a play in Paris have
no time to translate to themselves, but it is not necessary
for them to do it either. And finally, it goes without
saying that the Englishman who really speaks French and
German well does not first construct his sentences in
English and then translate them in the same way as a schoolboy
translates his exercises. No; in all these mental
processes, English occupies a place in the background and
is just as superfluous as for instance German is for me
while I am reading or talking French. How often are we
not asked the meaning of some foreign word or expression
which we know very well and would neither pay any special
attention to in a book nor hesitate to use in conversation
but yet we cannot give any English equivalent for it without
resorting to some vague uncertain circumlocution; then
suddenly, after a good deal of speculation, we hit upon the
correct English expression. Or the questioner may suggest
first one and then another translation of something French
or Latin; we do not feel satisfied, but cannot mention anything
better; then he attempts a new suggestion and
instantly it flashes upon us that this is the best. In all these
cases, then, we have clearly and distinctly understood the
foreign expressions without being able to translate them (or
before we could translate them). Of course the German
word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fall</i> is only one and the same word for me whether it
be used in such a manner as to be best rendered by English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<i>case</i>, <i>instance</i>, or by <i>fall</i>, <i>decline</i>, <i>descent</i>, or in still another
way (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">unglücksfall</i>, accident; <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlimmsten falles</i>, if the worst
come to the worst; <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">auf keinen fall</i>, on no account, etc.).
When I come across the word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gegen</i>, I do not consciously
stop to decide if it “means” <i>towards</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>about</i> or <i>against</i>;
nor in the case of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bleiben</i>, if it is to be rendered by <i>remain</i>,
<i>stay</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>continue</i>, <i>keep</i>, or <i>survive</i>. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a dû se taire</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle a le
cœur serré</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il traite le sujet avec la compétence qu’on lui
connaît</i>&mdash;should I really have to hunt for the proper
translation every time such an idiom occurs? Should I
stop at every perspicuous German compound until I
had found the cumbersome English circumlocution that is
often needed to render it? No; in all of these cases, I
directly and spontaneously connect the idea with the
language in which it is expressed without going any roundabout
way through the words of my native language. Any
one who introduces a foreign word into his English either
because there is no exact equivalent in English or, at least,
because he cannot recall it for the moment, also thereby
shows that people really can, and very frequently do, learn
words in other languages without getting at their meaning
through their mother-tongue.</p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il trouva la pauvre fille dans un état à faire pitié.” “On
a voulu trouver dans ses œuvres un pessimisme de parti
pris.” “Pour lui, il y allait de la gloire de cette maison
qu’il servait depuis sa jeunesse.”</span> How many a man will
understand without difficulty such sentences as these and a
hundred others, and yet hesitate at once when asked to
translate them! We must on the whole make a distinction
between the ability to feel at home in a language and skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in translating from or into it; even if these two accomplishments
may be found in one and the same person, yet
they are not seldom to be seen separated. If I may be
allowed to talk about myself, I may say that my ability to
translate quickly and well is so decidedly inferior to my
ability to understand and to express my thoughts in those
languages which I have studied, that I should scarcely like
to have my linguistic attainments judged by my skill in
translation.</p>

<p>The lately deceased art-critic, P. G. Hamerton, the
author of that interesting book <cite>French and English</cite>, says
about himself: “As my wife was a Parisian with a strong
taste for the classical literature of her own country, I
became her pupil in French and she became mine in English.
We made it a rule in our private conversation never
to allow a fault in either language to pass uncorrected, and
we read aloud to each other a great deal.... In the
use of languages I have one faculty which seems to be
rather uncommon: that of keeping them entirely separated.
When speaking or writing French I am, for the time
being, like one totally ignorant of English, as English
words do not occur to me, and I never translate anything,
not even weights and measures, or money, or the thermometer,
from one language to the other, but think in
each, independently.”</p>

<p>When Hamerton here says that this ability is unusual,
he no doubt means that it is unusual in so high a degree
as he had it. Perhaps it is not all people who get so far
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dix-huit degrés</i>, for instance, awakens in them just
as precise a conception as the corresponding degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of heat in terms of Fahrenheit; and yet, no doubt, by
habit, this too will become quite natural for those who
care very much to have the temperature expressed in
degrees. It is just like the foreigner in France who, after
a very short time, involuntarily begins to calculate with
French money, so that he does not have to transpose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux
francs cinquante</i> into English shillings and pence before he
can judge as to whether the price of an article is high or low.</p>

<p>Though I may admit, however, that this ability to feel at
home in a strange language is not altogether common in
so high a degree, yet I think it may be said that the same
ability only in a less degree is not unusual. I mean that
it is rather the exception than the rule for people who read
foreign books to any extent at all to have to translate to
themselves in order to understand what they are reading,
with the exception, perhaps, of some difficult lines here
and there. And even in the difficult places, where they
have to resort to their mother-tongue in order to understand
the meaning, it is generally only one or two words
which have to be looked up, so they generally do not even
pause to translate the whole clause in which those words
have occurred; still less frequently do they stop merely to
untangle some involved sentence construction. When a
whole population has to make constant use of two
languages, the circumstances are no doubt always the
same as among the Wends in Lusatia: “They speak both
Wendish and German with equal fluency; yet the common
people generally refuse when they are asked to translate
something from one language to another: ‘he cannot do
it,’ or, as one of my informants expressed himself, ‘he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
afraid to.’ He can, however, without difficulty repeat in
German a tale which he has heard in Wendish, and <i>vice
versâ</i>, and likewise he can give the exact translation of
single words.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>While there are countless persons who have use for the
ability to understand a foreign language directly, and while
there is at all events a constantly increasing number of
people who need to express their thoughts in a foreign
language, there are really very few who will ever have any
occasion to exercise skill in translation. There are many
who write private letters in German, etc., but they do not
compose an English text first which they then proceed to
translate with exactness. Even those who have foreign
business letters to write for someone else are not generally
given every word that is to stand in them, but merely a
rough draft of the contents, which they are to clothe in
a foreign language as best they can. There remain, then,
the few translators connected with the law-courts, the providers
of translated novels, and finally the very small
number of choice spirits who have the courage to grapple
with the valuable and charming art of transplanting poetry
in a poetical rendering. But they may all find comfort in
the fact that skill in translation at the very bottom rests on
that same direct command of language that we all need,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
there is no need for them to feel dissatisfied if we refuse
to recognize skill in translation as the end and aim of all
instruction in languages.</p>

<p>Our ideal must rather be the nearest possible approach
to the native’s command of the language, so that the words
and sentences may awaken the same ideas in us as in the
native&mdash;and these ideas, as we well know, are not the same
as those called forth by the corresponding words in our
own language. The relations between languages are not
like the relations between mathematical equivalents; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cœur</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">herz</i>, <i>heart</i> do not all cover the same ground, to say
nothing of the difference between <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sens</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sinn</i>, <i>sense</i>, etc.
Even when the literal meaning may be said to be the same,
the suggestions associated with the words vary in the
different languages, suggestions arising from related words,
from words that are similar in sound or similar in some
other way, from frequent combinations in which the words
occur, etc. The same animal is in English called <i>bat</i>,
in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauvesouris</i>, in German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fledermaus</i>, in Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vespertilio</i>, in Danish <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">flagermus</i>, but what a difference in
the suggestions! The French, the German and the Danish
words call attention to the animal’s resemblance to a mouse,
the Danish word besides to its flapping movement (a
suggestion which must be lost for the Germans since
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">flattern</i> has taken the place of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fledern</i>), but the French
word to its bald appearance; the Latin word makes us
think of the time of day when the animal is abroad, but
the English word <i>bat</i> is rather an abstract expression without
any suggestiveness, and we can understand why
Tennyson declared that the provincial word <i>flittermouse</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was far more suitable for poetical use than <i>bat</i>. These
“undertones” of the words sound more distinctly in
puns, rhymes, etc., but still they always lie lurking in the
background of our conscience. It is all such things as
these, together with the fact that some languages carefully
distinguish between certain shades of grammar or meaning
which are of no consequence in other languages, where the
finesses seem to be extended to totally different points, and
furthermore together with different habits as to order of
words, etc., etc., which, taken all in all, make it impossible
for any translation ever to be a perfect reproduction of the
original: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">traduttore traditore!</i></p>

<p>For all these reasons, it is not translation (or skill in
translation) that we are aiming at in teaching foreign
languages.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>


<p>But for all that translation might still be a useful and
indispensable <em>means</em> in the service of language instruction.
In order to judge of this we must have a clear conception
of the different ways in which translation can be and really
is used:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>)&mdash;Translation <em>into English</em> is a means of getting the
pupil to understand the foreign language, as for
instance, when I tell him that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval</i> means
“horse,” or when I translate a whole sentence
for him;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>)&mdash;Translation into English is a means of testing
whether the pupil understands, as, for instance,
when I ask him what <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval</i> means in English, or
when I let him translate a whole sentence;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>)&mdash;Translation <em>from English</em> is a means of giving
the pupil practice in producing something in the
foreign language;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>)&mdash;Translation from English is a means of testing
whether the pupil can express himself in the
foreign language. It is really a subdivision of
this when the teacher lets a pupil translate an
English sentence in order to see if he understands
some grammatical rule in the foreign
language.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear that <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are right closely connected, likewise
<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; yet it will be seen later that the one does
not necessarily presuppose the other, as is no doubt
generally assumed.</p>

<p>Advocates of the routine-method will throw <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and
<i>d</i> together indiscriminately and say about them all that
translation is an excellent and indeed the only practical
means.</p>

<p>But their opponents, now, maintain that in none of these
four cases is translation the only means&mdash;very far from it!&mdash;and
that besides it is not equally valuable in all instances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>)&mdash;There is always danger in translation; but in
spite of this there are many who in certain cases
will use this means as being the surest and
quickest way of getting the pupils to understand,
but in other cases will try to do without
it; some teachers even think that in all cases
they can find other and better means of getting
the pupils to comprehend the meaning of foreign
expressions.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>)&mdash;As a means of testing whether the pupil understands
the foreign language, it is a tolerably good
thing to let him translate, but only tolerably good;
it is not always reliable, and ought in many cases
to be a last resort.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>)&mdash;Translation from English is, for beginners at
least, an extremely poor means in comparison
with the many other hitherto generally neglected
ways in which the teacher may get a pupil to say
(or write) something in the foreign language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das übersetzen in die fremdsprache zum zwecke
der erlernung derselben gehört einfach in das
gebiet pädagogischer sünden und verirrungen</span>”
(Bierbaum, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die neueren sprachen</cite>, i. 57).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>)&mdash;As a test of whether the pupil can express himself
in the other language, an oral or written
exercise in translation is either illusory or is at
least suitable only for the most advanced pupils.</p></div>

<p>These assertions must now be made good, especially by
the suggestion of other means which may be substituted for
translation. I shall not continue strictly to observe the
distinctions between the four categories, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. In
order to avoid tedious repetitions of expressions like “the
foreign language in question,” I shall in the following pages
say in short “the language” in contrast to English.</p>

<p>Are there other means by which I can get the pupil to
comprehend the meaning of foreign words and sentences?
Yes; in the first place by means of <em>direct observation</em> or
immediate perception (what the Germans call <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">anschauung</span>).
This applies to substantives which designate objects, etc.,
to be found in the school-room: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fenêtre, porte, banc,
chaise, tableau (noir), craie, livre, plume, crayon, montre,
élève, maître (professeur)</span>, etc. All that is necessary is to
point to the objects with such remarks as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est</i> (or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà</i>) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
craie</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on appelle ça le tableau noir</i>, etc., and the pupil cannot
mistake the meaning of each word. Furthermore, this is
the best way to teach the most necessary words relating to
the human body: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête, cheveux, nez, yeux, bouche, lèvres,
barbe, joue, oreille, bras, main, doigt</span>, etc. But in addition
to the many substantives there are also a number of words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of other classes which can be learned in this manner:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà une fenêtre, et voilà une <i>autre</i> fenêtre; Pierre est un
élève, Paul est un autre élève</span>; words like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ici</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">là</i>; especially
a number of verbs of action: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>j’écris</i>; Victor écrit. je <i>prends</i>
la craie; Jean prend la craie. je me <i>lève</i>; Pierre se lève.
<i>je m’assieds</i>, je <i>marche</i> (vers la porte), <i>j’ouvre</i> la porte, je
<i>ferme</i> la porte; je <i>donne</i> le livre à Pierre, Pierre me donne
le livre</span>, etc. At the same time as the teacher or the pupil
says something or other, the teacher illustrates the action.
In that manner, already in the first stage, before the pupils
have any French vocabulary to operate with, a number of
words and sentences may be learned without the use of a
single English word. Yes, even the various tenses of the
verbs can be explained by this method. If, for instance,
in the course of their reading, the pupils come across <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il a
pris</i> and they do not understand it, the teacher can show
what it means&mdash;this of course does not apply to the very
first lessons&mdash;by first taking the chalk and saying: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je prends
la craie</span>, then a book: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je prends le livre de Jean</span>, then his
hand: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je prends sa main</span>, and then saying: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’abord j’ai
pris la craie, puis j’ai pris le livre de Jean, et enfin j’ai pris
sa main</span>. With a little ingenuity a good deal can be
brought in in this way; some material in French has
been well arranged in P. Passy and T. Tostrup, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leçons de
choses</span>. I shall later come to the question as to whether
and how the pupils are to repeat what the teacher says in
this way, as likewise to the objection that the pupils in
reality understand these words in English. Here I shall
merely caution against taking too much material of this kind
at a stretch; it is best to intersperse it with other things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, the meaning of the words may
be communicated through <em>mediate perception</em>, through
pictures. This is what Miss Goldschmidt with so much
energy has put into practice in her “picture-words” and in
other books on the same plan, which have been edited
partly by her and partly by others. Each page contains a
collection of pictures representing a series of objects belonging
to the same sphere of ideas. Sometimes they are
joined together to make a whole scene; sometimes the
objects remain separated, without being brought into connection
with each other; some of the pictures are well put
together; others present several curiosities, as, for instance,
a telescope freely hovering in a rainbow. Each object is
supplied with a number referring to lists where the corresponding
French (English, etc.) words are given. In many
German schools, and in several places in Denmark now too,
large picture-charts are used to hang upon the schoolroom
wall, especially the Hölzel charts, where, for instance, on a
winter-picture are collected representations of the most important
things belonging to winter. Then the teacher can
point to one of these things and at the same time explain it
in the language which is being studied. Finally pictures
can also be used to illustrate a narrative or descriptive text,
as in the English primers published by Sarauw and myself.</p>

<p>There have been several objections raised against the
perception-method. Thus Sweet says that the idea is not
so sharply defined as in the case of translation. If we see
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i> by the side of (the picture of) a silk hat, we do not
know if it merely designates that kind of hat or other kinds
too, so that the translation “hat” is more apt to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the correct idea. Or if the teacher points to his mouth and
says <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouche</i>, the pupils might just as well think that it means
lip, etc. The objection comes from a closet philosopher,
who has not seen the thing in practice; there is almost no
danger except for one who would try to learn a language
by himself and exclusively through pictures. In oral instruction,
such mistakes are scarcely frequent enough to be
worth mentioning, even if it might be a good thing perhaps
for teachers to realize that they are possible&mdash;they even
occur now and then in a child’s apprehension of his native
language, which in large part follows exactly these same
paths. If the teacher understands his business, no mistake
at all occurs or else it is soon corrected, for of course he
will never stop at merely pointing to the object and giving
the word, but he will immediately use it in sentences and
connections in which the meaning becomes perfectly clear;
for instance, if he only says <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu as une bouche et deux lèvres</i>,
or, after having pointed to his mouth and said <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouche</i>, he
asks one of the boys: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Combien as-tu de bouches?</i> there will
be no danger of such mistakes; indeed all danger is generally
precluded from the very beginning, for when the
teacher points to his mouth, he is not apt to say merely
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouche</i>, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà la bouche</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà ma bouche</i>, where the
singular form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma</i> unmistakably indicates the correct
meaning. Such misunderstandings as in the case of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i> are no doubt of rare occurrence, but at all events,
the teacher may prevent them too by talking about his own
and the pupils’ hats with the use of the same word.</p>

<p>Another opponent of the perception-method has said
that it causes disturbance in the class when the teachers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
modern languages now get up, now sit down, open the door,
close the door, blow their noses, pull their boots off and on
(?) etc.</p>

<p>A third opponent carefully depicts all the asides a pupil
will think of when the teacher, in order to teach him the
word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gants</i>, pulls his gloves out of his pocket: “They are
pretty bad specimens,” or “Oho! he has brought his best
ones along to-day because he knew he was going to use
them,” etc. Of course the method can be driven to caricature,
and of course the discipline can become lax if the
teacher goes through the various actions with too much
restlessness, but in general the method does not require
very different or more disturbing movements than those
which take place in every or every other lesson: a pupil
goes to the blackboard or the door or opens a window.
And if there is any spirit in the teaching, the pupils indulge
in no more irrelevant asides than in other lessons.</p>

<p>There seems to be greater weight in the objection that
only apparently is the foreign word directly attached to the
idea by means of the perception-method, since either
a real hat or a picture of one immediately suggests to the
pupil the English word <i>hat</i>, so that after all we do not
avoid the roundabout way through the native language, as
we desire; the hobgoblin moves with us. Well, if we
think it is possible entirely to prevent English words from
turning up in the children’s consciousness, we certainly
deceive ourselves. But if we are more modest in our
demands and simply want the foreign language to be kept
as much as possible in the foreground and English in the
background, then it cannot be denied that it must make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for this end when it is not necessary for either the teacher
or the pupil to mention the English word. And the more
they both become accustomed to this method of teaching,
the more previously learned words there are for the new
ones to be associated with, and the more ingenious the
teacher is to vary the whole, the more seldom do the
English words occur to the pupil.</p>

<p>With the pictures as a basis of suggestion, there can and
ought to be conducted talks in the language, at least after
the very first lessons are past. It is but seldom necessary
to resort to the native language, and the time is almost
exclusively occupied in hearing and saying something in
the language. But this can best be done when the
pictures not only suggest single words but are rich in
content. Thus Mrs. Freudenthal, in Finland, has to a
large extent in her teaching used reproductions of genre
paintings, which give occasion for spinning out whole
narratives suggested by the pictures. Perhaps it is still
better, as Sarauw and I have done in our book for beginners
in English, to supply the tales (or other selections) with
little illustrations; they may occasion conversations which
have more or less to do with the text and which can be
conducted with essentially the same vocabulary; and the
teacher ought also to return now and then to previously
discussed pictures, which may be treated more fully than
before on account of the progress made by the pupils in
the meanwhile.</p>

<p>Pictures, then, are of undoubted significance in the
teaching of languages, even if their scope must not be
overrated and they must not be used as the only means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of explanation&mdash;all one-sidedness is hurtful. But the
pictures ought to be characteristic of the foreign land and
people, especially when they are to be used beyond the
beginner stage. I am not the first one to reproach Miss
Goldschmidt because she gives pictures showing, for
instance, a Danish sitting-room, a Danish postman, etc.,
and lets the pupils use the same pictures in learning all
three foreign languages, something which is not exactly
calculated to win interest but must be pretty monotonous
whereas exactly what should be done is to open the
pupil’s eyes to the manifold and characteristic differences
existing between the various nations. Schools ought to be
well supplied with pictures on the walls and illustrated
works which may serve to give the pupils some enlightenment
about French and German conditions of life, natural
scenery, buildings, art, institutions. Foreign illustrated
papers will be found to contain much useful material, and
the teacher ought frequently to use 5&ndash;10 minutes or more
of the lesson to discuss such a picture in the language with
the pupils. That would be an excellent way in which to
supplement the teaching based on the text-book.</p>

<p>But not only such ready-made pictures may be used in
teaching languages. The teacher can often, by means of
rough chalk-drawings on the blackboard, illustrate various
things in the text which is being read and base his
explanations (in the language) on them. The few times
I have done it, the pupils immediately took to it,
so that I began to deplore my great lack of skill in
drawing. If there was any subject that was neglected
when I went to school, it was drawing. Now people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have, fortunately, begun to get their eyes open to
the importance of this branch, first and foremost for
teachers of all subjects as a help in their teaching, and,
secondly, for the pupils as the good thing it is from an
educational point of view for them to learn to see an object
correctly and to reproduce what they see in a drawing.
And just as in the case of natural history and geography,
the drawings of the pupils now are an important feature of
the instruction, so they might play a similar part in the
teaching of languages. It is a splendid idea that has
been put into practice in “<span lang="da" xml:lang="da">Det danske selskabs skole</span>.” I
shall quote from its “Beretning,” 1900:</p>

<p>“Exercises in drawing have also played an important
part. Before the lesson begins there is written on the
blackboard one subject for each pupil to illustrate by a
drawing. Each one has a certain amount of space apportioned
to him. The pupil is ordered to draw only such
things as he can mention and explain in German. But of
course the intention is that much more is to be drawn.
For instance, if the subject is a wagon, the pupil
naturally draws both wheels, wagon-pole, stud-stave, side
pieces, seat, driver with whip, horses, harness, etc. The
pupil has to explain his drawing to the class, and of
course he gets into a tight place; the result is that his
interest is aroused for what all the things are called, and he
pays close attention to the words when the teacher says
them. Fourteen boys in a class can finish their drawings
in 10 minutes, and it takes 30 minutes to go through the
14 drawings.” (C. Lambek.)</p>

<p>Here it looks as if the subject were given in Danish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and perhaps the words learned in the exercise have been
taken up too much in detail. I should think it might be
still better to announce the subject orally and rather fully
in the language, to say, for instance, to a Danish pupil
who is learning English&mdash;You draw a picture of a two-storied
house with three windows in each story and one
door; outside the house a man is to stand smoking his
pipe; or, you draw a carriage and pair, inside the carriage
is a gentleman, but you see only the tip of his nose; a dog
is running fast behind the carriage. If there is&mdash;as there
always ought to be&mdash;blackboard space enough for several
pupils to execute their drawings at the same time, so much
the better; the rest of the class can be occupied with
something else until the drawings are finished; then they
are first explained by the drawer, thereupon by one or
several of the other pupils; of course both the teacher
and the pupils call attention to anything that has been
forgotten in the drawing, and new points are brought up,
as suggested by Mr. Lambek. Also in connection with
little stories, the pupils may be asked to make drawings to
show that they have understood what they have been
reading. In speaking about the use of pictures, I have
wandered a little from my point of departure, namely, the
ways in which (aside from translation) the pupil may be
taught the meaning of a foreign word.</p>

<p>All of us who are further advanced must confess to ourselves
that in reading foreign books we have often omitted
to look up an unfamiliar word in the dictionary, because its
meaning was perfectly clear from the <em>context</em>. And we
have all learned thousands of words in our mother-tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the same way. Then why not use this experience in the
teaching of foreign languages? Because it leads to guesswork,
to carelessness in studying, to an approximate and
uncertain comprehension, is the answer we get. Granted&mdash;as
far as some cases are concerned! There are many
combinations where the meaning of a word may be
“scented” through the context, and where a conscientious
teacher cannot remain satisfied without some proof that the
pupil really understands the word; and there are cases
where the teacher imagines that the pupils cannot help
seeing the meaning immediately, and yet their guesses are
all wrong. But still the ability to arrive at the meaning of
an unfamiliar word through the text is valuable and does
not deserve to be neglected, but should, on the contrary,
be cultivated&mdash;under control, of course. At all events,
there can be no danger in using really self-interpreting
sentences where the meaning of an unfamiliar word may
be assumed with unfailing certainty and without guesswork.
In a sentence like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y a <i>douze mois</i> dans <i>l’année</i></span>,”
the pupil who is acquainted with any two of the three
italicized words will be able to reason out the meaning of
the third with as great accuracy as in the equation a + b = c
the unknown quantity may be found when the two are
given. And if you continue: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le premier s’appelle janvier,
le second s’appelle février, le troisième s’appelle mars</span>, etc.,
then it is no guesswork at all if the pupils gather both
the ordinal numerals and the names of the months. The
same may be said of the following <span class="lock">sentences&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le jour se divise en vingt-quatre heures; l’heure se divise
en soixante minutes, et la minute en soixante secondes.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soixante secondes font une minute; soixante minutes
font une heure; vingt-quatre heures font un jour; sept
jours font une semaine; cinquante-deux semaines et quelques
jours font une année; cent années font un siècle.</span></p>

<p>Here the pupil can infer the meaning of a number of
words without needing the teacher’s translation. So it is
only a waste of time to let the pupil himself translate
such pieces&mdash;for he can do that half-asleep without looking
very much at the French, and he does not learn much that
way. No; let him repeat them in French until he can say
them fluently, then let him isolate the ordinals: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le premier,
le second</span> ..., thereupon the names of the months:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">janvier, février</span> ...; thereupon go through both series
backwards, and then finally answer questions at random:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment s’appelle le troisième mois? Quel est le dixième
mois?</span> etc. Or in connexion with the second selection, let
him go through all the divisions of time, first beginning
with the smallest and then with the largest (with the use
of the article <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une</i>); then ask: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment se divise
l’heure? Comment se divise le jour? Combien de
secondes a une minute? Trois heures, combien de
minutes? Deux années, combien de mois?</span> etc., etc. In
this way it seems as if a teacher can with complete confidence
continue for a long time to keep even those pupils
occupied who do not know much French, without needing
to mention a single English word.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Now of course there are only few subjects which can
thus be talked about in one self-interpreting sentence after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the other: Sweet has, in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elementarbuch</span>, got hold
of more of that sort of thing than any other author of
similar text-books that I know of; but almost any text will
be found to contain sentences where the general sense
unmistakably indicates the meaning of the new words;
the more of that kind of combinations the pupil commits
to memory the better for him. The ability to infer the
meaning from the context ought rather to be encouraged
and practised than ought the tendency to go by resemblances
to words in the mother-tongue or in other languages;
even if much may be learned in this way (Eng. <i>send</i>,
German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">senden</i>; Eng. <i>ruin</i>, Ger. French <i>ruine</i>, etc.), yet
there is still reason to caution against too much confidence
in resemblances, for they often lead us astray (even
in the case of “etymologically identical words”). Most of
the really valuable associations of this kind come of their
own accord.</p>

<p>But to continue, the new words may simply be explained
in the language to the pupil&mdash;this of course really means
that the teacher puts the word into a self-interpreting
sentence, so it is merely a subdivision of what we have just
been speaking about. Anyone who has been accustomed
to use the excellent French and English dictionaries, large
or small, all the way from Littré and Murray to the little
Larousse or Annandale’s Concise, knows how often he has
been able to find in them quite sufficient explanations of
unfamiliar words. Why not use this experience too in the
teaching of foreign languages? Thus, for instance, explain
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">veuf</i>: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un veuf est un homme dont la femme est morte;
une veuve est une femme dont le mari est mort.</span> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
explanation, to be sure, contains no more information than
is to be got out of the simple translation “widower”
(“widow”); but there are cases where an explanation gives
better information than a translation. It is not improbable
that many Englishmen, when given the translation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primage</i>
or <i>hat-money</i> for German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kapplaken</i>, will remain just as
wise as they were before, but they will immediately understand
it if it is explained in German: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">prämiengeld, das
früher dem schiffskapitän ausser der fracht gezahlt wurde,
ursprünglich freiwilliges geschenk, dann vertragsmässig
bestimmt.</span> The English word <i>dentil</i> is in English-German
dictionaries translated by <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kälberzahn</i>, but I suppose that
most Germans would get more out of Annandale’s definition:
“the name of the little cubes or square blocks often
cut for ornament on Greek cornices,” or Funk-Wagnalls’
definition: “One of a series of small square tooth-like
ornamental blocks in the bed-moulding of the cornices of
some Ionic and other entablatures” (here even an instructive
illustration). Well, such technical words, where we do
not even know the English term, we shall scarcely have
much use for in school; but sometimes on account of the
chance vagaries of language a translation does not give as
exact an idea as an explanation. If I say that <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">stockwerk</i>
means <i>floor</i>, I run the risk of getting an exercise with
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">stockwerk</i> used where there ought to be <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fussboden</i>; but if I
explain it as “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">eine der horizontalen einteilungen eines
hauses</span>,” or something like that, there is no danger of any
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must of course be admitted that
there are many words where an English translation gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the information required more quickly and more clearly
than it could be given in a long explanation in the foreign
language; and the teacher ought to consider in each
separate case which of the two ways of helping the pupil is
to be preferred. Still he must not let laziness influence
him to give the translation, which of course is always
easiest for him, but he must remember that an explanation
in the language always has the great advantage that the
pupil, in addition to the new words, hears a number of
others which he thereby reviews, as it were, and that the
pupil is for the time being wholly occupied with the foreign
language. Besides, these explanations amuse the pupils
because they get more intellectual work out of them than
out of translations, which are given to them gratis.</p>

<p>However, such explanations ought perhaps not to be
used to any great extent in the glossaries of text-books,
especially in readers for beginners; here it is best to weave
them into the text itself. In the first place, in such glossaries
or notes, the explanations naturally become drier and
more like definitions than is necessary; in the second
place, the pupil who does not feel inclined to read those
few lines through is tempted to get some comrade, a parent,
or a sister to tell him in short the meaning of the word:
that is, to translate it. To counteract this by <em>always</em>
requiring the pupil to commit the given explanation to
memory is not exactly a wise plan, since it may easily lead to
mere thoughtless memory-work. For the glossary ought to
play no more important part in really good teaching for
beginners than as a help to the forgetful pupil in his home-preparation,
where he can look up the meaning (and pronunciation)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of a word which he cannot remember, I do
not hesitate to use translation there.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The explanations in the foreign language are especially
in place when the teacher assigns the lesson and goes
through it orally. This must be done with the greatest
care and with a view to giving the pupils a really full and
all round insight into the new selection to be read&mdash;with as
much life and as few English words and sentences as
possible. Much depends upon the way in which the
teacher reads the piece; many pieces can be read in such
a way that the pupils cannot help understanding them: for
instance, by the use of stress, emphasis of contrasts, change
of voice, etc. And then he can point to various things by
way of illustration&mdash;and it does no harm to point at the
window, for instance, on coming across the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fenêtre</i>,
even if the class has had that word before. Many words
can be made clear by means of gestures, etc.; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">scie</i>, for
instance, can be illustrated by a sawing movement accompanied
by a wheezing sound; for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tailler</i>, it is only necessary
to cut for half a second with an imaginary knife; thus the
meaning of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boire</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chanter</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de pied</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grimper</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joyeux</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mécontent</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pleurer</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dormir</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taper</i>, and many other words
can be given; as a rule, merely little (not noisy!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
suggestions are necessary for the class to understand
immediately.</p>

<p>Finally there are circumlocutions in the language, not
straightforward definitions as in the dictionaries, but also
other explanations; often it is only necessary to lead the
thoughts of the pupils in upon the right track. On coming
across German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hauptstadt</i>, for instance, the teacher can say:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">London ist die hauptstadt Englands, Paris ist die hauptstadt
Frankreichs, und Kopenhagen ist die hauptstadt
Dänemarks</span>&mdash;and then ask one of the pupils: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heinrich,
weisst du jetzt was hauptstadt bedeutet?</span> Perhaps
he will answer, “Capital,” but then the teacher can say:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ganz richtig, aber kannst du nicht das wort auf deutsch
erklären?</span> The pupil: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja, die hauptstadt ist die grösste
stadt eines landes.</span> The teacher: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja wohl, es ist die erste
stadt, die grösste stadt, die wichtigste oder bedeutendste
stadt eines landes.</span> Then he may add: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nun, Johan, kannst
du andere hauptstädte Europas anführen</span>, and when he has
mentioned a few, the teacher says: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schön, das genügt</span>, and
passes on. Even if many words are used, yet they are not
superfluous because they are foreign words, and therefore a
few minutes’ conversation in this manner is about just as
useful as if a whole page had been read in the language.
And the pupils will ever after remember the meaning of
the word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hauptstadt</i> much better than if the teacher had
simply told them the translation and then continued with
the reading. In every separate case, the teacher must
feel his way to decide where there yet remains something
that is not understood, and where further explanation would
be superfluous or tiresome; that is also one of the reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
why such circumlocutions had better be left to the teacher
than included in the text-book.</p>

<p>Of course it is necessary to have practice and a good deal
of tact in order to give this kind of explanations naturally
and well, and carefully adapted to the needs and standpoint
of the class; the teacher must have a pretty good idea of
what the class knows beforehand, and thereby which words
and expressions he may use with certainty; the easier and
the more colloquial the words are which are used in the
circumlocution, and the more concretely it is expressed, the
better. It is better to explain too much than too little, and
one must not be afraid of using a number of words when
they only are in the foreign language. There is some truth
in Gabelentz’ remark: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesprächige leute von engem
gedankenkreise sind für den anfang die besten lehrmeister</span>”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>;
the teacher must not exactly make himself stupid, but he
must admit that no matter how high he himself stands
intellectually, he can very well learn something from the
nursery-method of teaching languages: for instance, that
taciturnity or conciseness of expression do not lead to the
goal. It pays to give some attention to this form of instruction
and to find out what kind of explanations are of
the greatest linguistic benefit to the pupils. It is not
difficult, as a rule&mdash;even without direct questions, which,
however, the teacher ought not to be sparing of<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;to feel
what is understood and what is not, just as the boys can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
easily be trained to say so immediately when there is something
that they do not understand. All that is necessary
is to make them feel confident that their teacher is
always willing and glad to answer their questions, and that
they will never be made fun of for asking. Sometimes, of
course, he may also make another pupil answer the question
if it is an easy one.</p>

<p>The following may serve as a connected specimen of the
method of procedure, even if I have, perhaps, explained a word
or two which for an English class would need no explanation.</p>

<p>It is best to go through the lesson for the next time in
the beginning of the hour, when both the teacher’s and the
pupils’ powers are freshest, and when there is sure to be
plenty of time for it; at the end of the hour the teacher
may be too hurried and nervous in his anxiety to get
through the proper amount before the bell rings. In going
through it, the teacher may either let the pupils look at
their books or require all books to be closed. The latter
is the better way, since then the pupils can give more
undivided attention to the teacher; for they must drink in
all his words and follow his slightest movements. In that
case it is no doubt always best for him to write down on
the blackboard each new word as he explains it, and after
everything has been explained he may close either by
reading the piece aloud himself (without interpolations)
or by letting one of the pupils read it. Yet it is not well
to follow one method of procedure all the time; and if the
piece is easy, so that there are only a few new words, it may
immediately be read aloud by one of the pupils (slowly,
not in a forced way!), who may stop and ask whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
there is anything that he does not understand. If a
sentence contains two or three unfamiliar words or some
other difficulty which has given occasion for a question, it
must by all means be read again connectedly without
interruption as soon as a period has been reached. Finally
the teacher can, if it seems necessary, as a further
guarantee, let one of the pupils give a free rendering of
the contents in his native language; that is a sort of
control, at all events until the class has become quite
accustomed to having the lesson gone through in this way.</p>

<p>Let me suggest here that, in going through the new
lesson, the teacher can also counteract the injury which an
unusual order of words or expression occurring in a selection
of poetry might do to the pupil’s instinct for the
natural language, by giving the prose order of words and
explaining it. For instance, the lines: “And everybody
in the house On tip-toe has to creep” can first be
explained as if they ran: “And everybody in the house
has to creep on tip-toe”; again, such an expression as <em>at
eve</em> may be altered to <em>in the evening</em>. Then when the pupil
sees the changed order of words and the unusual expression
in his book, he will understand that they are due to the
poetical form. Therefore he will not be tempted to
imitate them; if he should do so in later exercises, the
teacher must correct him, since there is no earthly reason
why the pupil should practise <em>using</em> anything else but
everyday language. It is, however, a matter of course that
whenever I have used verses in my own books for
beginners in English, I have tried to find such as contained
very few deviations from the usual form of the language.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>


<p>We have then come to the following result with respect
to translation as a means of interpreting a foreign
language to the pupils (p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a> <i>a</i>): it is not the only and
the best means; it ought to be used sparingly; and at
all events it is not necessary to translate whole connected
pieces, but merely a word or, at the very most, a sentence
now and then. But this investigation has already thrown
some light upon our next point, namely, translation as <em>a
means of testing</em> whether the pupils understand the foreign
language (p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a> <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>Here, too, observation may take the place of translation.
The pupil who obeys the teacher’s command, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">montre-moi
la fenêtre</i>, by pointing at the window shows that he understands
the word just as well as the one who in answer to
the question: what is the meaning of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fenêtre</i>? answers,
window. Likewise the one who can point to the right
thing when the teacher shows him a picture and says; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">où
est le chapeau du garçon?</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">où sont ses souliers?</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vois-tu le toit
de la maison?</i> etc., or the one who carries out a command
like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prends la craie</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lève-toi</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assieds-toi</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donne-moi ton livre</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prends le livre de Jean et donne-le à Henri</i>&mdash;especially when
he at the same time says: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà la fenêtre</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà le chapeau du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
garçon</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà la craie</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je me lève</i>, etc., with a correct application
of the words desired. Nor can there be any doubt that
a boy has understood a French question when he can give
a sensible answer in the same language, or that he has
understood a narrative which has been told or read to him
when he can retell it (in English, or still better in French).</p>

<p>The teacher is no doubt most tempted to let the pupils
translate when he wants to make sure that they know the
new selection which has been assigned to them for home-study.
But even in this case, if the teacher has only gone
through the lesson on assigning it (as indicated above) in a
detailed and lively way, and with continual appeal to the
pupils, so that the whole does not become a mere monologue
by the teacher, the translation test is not as necessary
as it would have been if the lesson had either not been
gone through at all or if the teacher had merely translated
it rapidly. He will often find it sufficient to ask a question
now and then about some single point in the selection,
especially if the selection is used for such exercises as will
be described below, which directly and indirectly show
whether the pupils have understood it all or not.</p>

<p>But still, let us assume that the teacher insists on having
the selection translated&mdash;and of course this may always be
a good thing once in a while by way of a change, most so
perhaps when the teacher has not been quite able to
digest and absorb the new methods. Then the best thing
for him to do is to require the translation immediately,
before the pupil has read the piece aloud. This is the
most reliable test as to whether the lesson really has been
learned in time, for the pupil has not the chance while he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
reading aloud to speculate about how it is to be translated,
and, on the other hand, when he comes to read it in the
foreign language, he is not disturbed by irrelevant thoughts
in his native language. Besides, the teacher must understand
that this translation is not the most important event
of the hour; it ought therefore to occupy as little time as
possible. The pupil must be required to deliver his
translation quickly, and it is not necessary to criticise the
English expressions with pedantic exactitude. As soon as
it is clear that the pupil understands perfectly, it is better
for the teacher himself to give the correct English expression
in passing, than to waste time in letting him find it
out for himself.</p>

<p>A little turn of expression, a word-formation, or an order of
words which is not quite English can very well be allowed
to pass unnoticed; it is just when there is no attention
paid to these things that they are less apt to be injurious
to the pupil’s English than when the translation is treated
as if it were the only thing. In case of any unusually
awkward expression, the teacher can indulge in a hearty
laugh together with the pupils and say: “Well, that is not
the very best English you are giving us, but the meaning
is clear enough, and all that we are concerned with here is
if you understand the French, and that you do. Of
course we know that you would never seriously say or write
anything like that in your mother-tongue.” No more
attention than this, it seems to me, ought to be paid to the
English in these oral translations&mdash;the less we occupy
ourselves with our native language during the French or
German lessons, the less will it become contaminated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
good English is not to be learned in <em>those</em> lessons, and poor
English the teacher must give both himself and his pupils
as little occasion as possible to use.</p>

<p>It is a different matter when <em>advanced pupils</em> can get
both pleasure and benefit out of occasional exercises in
translation. Then these must be chosen so that there are
considerable deviations between the foreign language and
English, which of course does not mean that the selected
specimen of the foreign language itself need be difficult to
understand. When the pupils are not daily occupied with
translation, but move freely in the foreign language, it would
just be great sport for them for a change to have a contest
as to who could find the best and most exact English
equivalents for foreign expressions. Thus there is no little
difference between this kind of exercise and those now
prevalent sight translations whose chief object seems to be
to test the vocabulary of the pupils. The translation
exercise that I have in mind should be conducted on about
these lines: the selection should be read aloud to the
class; if it contains any unfamiliar words, they should be
explained in the manner described above, or, if they are
translated instead, there should be given (as in a dictionary)
perhaps five or six English equivalents to choose between;
thereupon the pupils (in class under supervision) write their
translations, which the teacher afterwards reads aloud and
compares, so that the pupils themselves may judge as to
whose translation has come nearest to the original and as to
whether that rendering is to be preferred where every little
element in the original has been taken into account but
where the English has thus become a little bit long drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
out, or that rendering which in pith and euphony can stand
comparison with the original, but where every detail has
not been strictly included, etc. In short, the exercise is
not to test the pupils’ knowledge in the foreign language,
but to give them some idea of the difficulties which the <em>art</em>
of translation has to contend with; and for the same reason
the pupils might also be asked sometimes to try their skill
in a metrical translation of a piece of poetry, but perhaps
only in such a way that all participation in the contest is
quite voluntary. Such selections might be chosen where
we have good poetical translations in our literature, which
could then be compared with the efforts of the pupils.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Some few exercises in artistic translation, which the
teacher carefully goes through with them, will help to give
the more advanced pupils a vivid perception of some of
the most delicate shades of variation in the languages as
means of expression for human thought&mdash;but as the daily
bread of language instruction that kind of exercise is not to
be recommended, especially not for beginners.</p>

<p>In the daily teaching of languages it is in a number of
cases quite superfluous to let the pupils translate. If the reading
selections are as easy as is desirable, there will be some
sentences in each lesson where neither the vocabulary nor
the construction presents the slightest difficulty. In other
sentences, the difficulty is simply due to a new word, but
if the teacher just devotes a few minutes right away to
hearing the new words, it is not necessary to have those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sentences translated either. There are, as we know, many
sentences which can be understood without any difficulty
at all, but which are still difficult to translate; if the pupil
knows the meaning of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schwören</i>, he will readily understand
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">er hat hoch und teuer geschworen</span>,” but it will not be so
easy for him to find the best way of rendering the adverbs,
and it is really purposeless to waste time over them. (See
also above, p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>).</p>

<p>Then finally there remains one or another really complicated
sentence, which can be separated out from the rest
and translated by the pupils&mdash;if the teacher in order to
save time does not prefer to translate the whole of it himself.
To test the pupil’s comprehension of single words
by letting him explain them in the language is not very
practical except to a limited extent; it might only be useful
in dealing with clever advanced pupils where it would not
necessarily degenerate into a mere committing of definitions
to memory. It is therefore more properly in place in
university instruction than in schools.</p>

<p>If any one now says that this method of procedure by
which translation as a test of the pupils’ comprehension of
what they have read is limited to the least possible, and in
many lessons even the very last remnant of it is done away
with, is far less satisfactory than the old-fashioned translating
over and over again of the whole lesson, and that the
teacher thus has no means of knowing what the pupils
understand and what not, I answer that, in the first place,
the pupils’ comprehension of a piece which they have even
translated several times in the old way is often poor enough;
the most incredible thoughtlessness can thrive under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shelter of rehearsed translations. In the second place (and
this is more important) the new method, when applied
in the right way, offers such an abundant variety of means
by which to sound the pupils and test how deeply they are
penetrating into both the language and contents of their
reading, that the teacher can easily feel sure of all essentials.
This will be made perfectly plain in the following description
of the manner in which the lessons ought to be conducted.</p>

<p>The selection must be read aloud. This had best be
done&mdash;at all events as a rule&mdash;by the teacher first; of
course he read it yesterday when he went through it for the
first time, but he did it more slowly, interrupting himself
with explanations, etc., for it was new for the pupils, and it
was necessary for them to comprehend the meaning. But
now the teacher may read it quickly, fluently, with the proper
“expression,” in short, in a lively and natural manner.
Then the pupil (the pupils) reads the same. At the beginner-stage,
the teacher must read each sentence by itself
and then get the pupils to repeat it while they have the
teacher’s pronunciation fresh in mind. Later on the
teacher may take larger sections, which may be parceled
out to the pupils in not too small portions. And one cannot
be too particular with the way in which this reading is
done; such stuttering, with pauses between words belonging
closely together, and neglect of natural and necessary pauses,
which used to be the rule, ought never to be tolerated, not
even as an exception. Even the first beginners ought to
be required to read each sentence connectedly with natural
expression; the teacher will not regret any trouble taken on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
this account, even if it involves ever so much repetition.
The more attention that is paid to this in the first few months,
the easier will it be later to require the pupils to read well&mdash;that
is, intelligibly and intelligently. This reading aloud,
besides being an exercise in pronunciation, also has its
other advantages for teaching purposes. Milton, already,
said that it is easy to hear only from the way in which a
piece is read, if the reader understands it or not. A really
good reader can in the most delicate manner lay bare his
appreciation, and vice versâ it is not difficult for a teacher
quick of hearing to detect, through a pupil’s uncertainty,
false emphasis, etc., what he has not understood (or learned)
in the piece he is reading&mdash;and then he can pounce on him
and get him to disclose the gap in his knowledge. When
this is filled up, of course he must read the piece again
better than the first time. The reading (or reciting) of dialogues,
with the parts assigned to various members of the
class, is always amusing, and can easily be used as a means
of encouraging natural emphasis and expression.</p>

<p><em>Reading in unison</em> ought not to be neglected; it has the
advantage of occupying the whole class at once, so that the
pupils get more practice in producing the foreign sounds
than when each one reads separately. Of course the teacher
cannot exercise so sharp a control as when he hears one at
a time, but yet he has by no means lost his control; by
practice, he can learn to detect single mistakes through the
whole chorus, and can even be tolerably certain as to where
they come from, and then he can get the suspected pupil
(or pupils) to read the difficult part alone. A help of a
similar nature in language-instruction is <em>singing</em>. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
teacher knows how to get his pupils to learn to sing some
of the verses in the reader, such class-singing will be found
to be both beneficial and enlivening; the words are more
easily remembered and the pronunciation is improved.
Singing in a foreign language as a factor in teaching was
already a number of years ago used by Paul Passy; it plays
an important part in the well-known “<span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Palmgrenske samskola</span>”
in Stockholm and in several German schools, and
has now of late years also been put into practice by some
Danish teachers in a very enjoyable manner; on several
occasions, the pupils have even given up a part of their
recess in order to sing foreign songs, when the teachers in
adjoining classes have looked askance at the singing during
the lesson-hours.</p>

<p>The oftener a piece is recited by a pupil, the more firmly
are the single words and especially the word-combinations
rooted in his memory; indeed it has even been attempted
to base a whole system of instruction on this experience, as
for instance in v. Pfeil’s highly interesting pamphlet: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie
lernt man eine sprache am leichtesten und besten?</span>”
(Breslau, 1884), and in several other works by the same
author, especially his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eins, Beiträge zur erziehung im
hause</span>” (3rd ed. Leipzig, 1879), which is also valuable for
other pedagogical suggestions. His method of procedure is
simple: no grammar; no translation from the mother-tongue;
only one language at a time, which then is pursued
at full speed (as a rule, six or more hours a week) in the
following manner. From the very beginning, an author is
taken up; the same piece (a couple of lines to begin with)
is first read aloud by the teacher, then by the pupil (if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
necessary, several times), is thereupon translated word by
word by the teacher (“to the complete neglect of German
sentence-construction; I would not tolerate having turns
of expression rendered into good German”) and afterwards
in the same way by the pupil, is then read aloud by the
pupil twice more in the course of the same lesson
and once again in the beginning of the next; finally
every Monday, the pupil reads aloud all that has been
gone through in the preceding week, and, not stopping
at that, whole books or large sections of books may
be read through connectedly after they have in this
manner been studied in instalments. Translation is omitted
as soon as there is no danger of miscomprehension,
and can soon be quite dispensed with in dealing with
easy sentences, which then are only <em>read</em> through the
stated number of times. During this repeated recitation
of the foreign sentences&mdash;at least four times after the pupil
has understood their meaning&mdash;the mother-tongue steps
into the background of its own accord, as it were, and the
idioms of the foreign language take firm hold upon the
memory. So far v. Pfeil, who, as he himself asserts&mdash;and
why should we not believe the man?&mdash;has had good results
in the course of a short time, both in taking and giving instruction
according to this method, which, to be sure, he
has only employed in private instruction, never having tried
it in a class. The impulse to make independent use of the
language-material thus learned makes its appearance very
early. Thus v. Pfeil tells about a pupil thirty-two years
old, who was brought up in a country school and who had
never before learned any foreign language, but who after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
ten lessons wrote him an Italian letter filling four octavo
pages, which, if not quite correct, was still quite intelligible.</p>

<p>But the method is terribly spiritless and mechanical,
perhaps you will say. Oh, yes&mdash;but is it really more spiritless
to read something aloud many times in which there is
some meaning&mdash;and some meaning which you understand&mdash;than
to translate something just as many times in which
there is no meaning at all, to say nothing of all the other
inane things which our old methods bring in their train,
such as grammatical rigmaroles, etc. However, it is by no
means my intention to give the v. Pfeil method an unqualified
recommendation, at all events not for school purposes;
it is too monotonous, and a more varied method of instruction
may surely have the same or greater advantages.
Already, in the preceding suggestions, it will have been
noticed that there were several deviations from v. Pfeil’s
method of procedure; here I shall merely call attention to
some things which we can learn from it: first, that we must
as soon as possible dispense with translation where it is
decidedly superfluous; and secondly, that our most important
object, namely, that the foreign turns of expression shall
make such an impression upon our pupils that they themselves
can use them on occasion, cannot be attained
without much repetition.</p>

<p>During the first lessons, it is of so much importance for
the pupils to catch and reproduce the sounds that the repetitions
which are necessary for practice in pronunciation
also serve to impress the sentences on their memory; the
teacher must only make sure that the pupils know the
meaning of each sentence before they begin to practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
pronouncing it, and that they do not forget it, so that the
words become merely meaningless sounds. Such a selection
as the one introducing my French primer (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La chèvre</span>)<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
lends itself well to this purpose; it occasions many repetitions
of the same sentences, still without becoming tiresome,
and the rhythm encourages natural, fluent and non-stuttering
recitation.</p>

<p>Later on, of course, there is no necessity for so much
repetition merely for the sake of the pronunciation. Then
one might require the texts to be committed to memory;
but this involves the danger that they might be learned and
remembered as lifeless series of words without any regard
for their meaning, especially if the teacher makes a routine
of it. But it might be quite useful every half-year, for
instance, or perhaps a little oftener, for the pupils to be
assigned each a piece to commit to memory; they may
themselves choose one of the pieces which have been read,
and then they must be expected to recite it with a very
good pronunciation and correct expression; no parrot-performance!
But otherwise the main point is for the
pupils to be occupied with the text repeatedly in such a
way that they do not lose sight of the meaning, so that
they may thus become so familiar with it that at last they
know it almost or entirely by heart without having been
directly required to commit it to memory. And this can at
the same time be done in such a way that the pupils are
led to say a number of things without following them in
the printed text, so that imperceptibly they are being pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>pared
to be able to say something in the language quite of
their own accord.</p>

<p>The teacher can divide the day’s lesson into sentences,
which he pronounces and the pupils repeat after him.
They have all closed their books, and when the teacher
says a sentence, no one knows who is to repeat it. By
this manner of teaching, which is also practicable in connection
with the exercises which I shall suggest later, the
teacher makes sure that a pupil’s attention cannot wander
in the confidence that it is some one else’s turn; it is
every one’s turn all the time. Thus the teacher says, for
instance: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les abeilles ressemblent aux mouches; Pierre,
répète.&mdash;Peter: L. a. r. a. m.&mdash;Teacher: Jean, répète ça
encore.&mdash;John: L. a. r. a. m.&mdash;Teacher: Mais elles ont
un aiguillon; répète, Charles.&mdash;Charles: m. e. o. u. ai.&mdash;Teacher:
Et elles piquent très fort quand elles sont en
colère; répète tout ça, Adolphe</span>, etc. Or, by way of a
change, the teacher can let the first one who repeats the
sentence mention one of his comrades, who is to repeat
it again.</p>

<p>Let me remark in passing that I have always given my
pupils French names immediately in one of the first
lessons; they are written on the blackboard (in phonetical
transcription of course, see below), and are very quickly
learned; as a rule, they are simply translations of their first
names, occasionally of a nickname, etc. It amuses the
pupils, and the teacher has the advantage of being able to
use their names in the middle of a French sentence without
marring the run of the language.</p>

<p>Other similar methods: pupil A reads aloud; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
every sentence, either the teacher or he himself appoints
someone to repeat.&mdash;Or: the teacher reads a sentence
aloud, then says: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traduis, Jules</span>; and after Julius’ translation:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répète ça en français, Paul</span>. This is better than to
let the same pupil first translate and then say it in French,
for thus neither one has to make a sudden change from
one basis of articulation to another.&mdash;Or: when a piece
has been read aloud as a whole, the teacher may render it
into English, a sentence at a time, and get the pupils to
express the same thought in French. This is, of course,
the most difficult of these methods and ought to be employed
with caution, for the pupils may easily be tempted
to <em>translate</em> from English (that is, to construct their French
after the English) instead of reproducing the French which
has been given, so that we thus risk all the dangers which
are commonly associated with the old-fashioned method of
translation from the native to the foreign language (cf.
below). Therefore it were best that this kind of exercise
merely be used occasionally, and only when the selection
employed is otherwise so familiar to the pupils that they
almost have it by heart in its French form. A variation of
all these exercises is, instead of a single pupil, to let the
whole class repeat the sentence in unison.</p>

<p>If the pupils should begin to lag, it indicates that the
class is not yet sufficiently familiar with the text, and then
the best thing to do is to say: Well, now you read the
piece through three times in chorus and then we shall begin
from the beginning in the same way as before with repetition
without the book. It does not take long before the
teacher can to advantage enter upon little deviations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
what the pupils know from the book; thus he secures himself
against thoughtless pattering out of what has been committed
to memory at home&mdash;which of course the attentive
teacher easily can detect through the manner in which the
pupil reads. But too great deviations are scarcely advisable;
they easily lead to confusion and to the danger of
wandering too far from the matter in hand, which is of
course to make the pupils thoroughly familiar with the
text. As examples of permissible changes of the sentences
which have just been employed, I shall mention: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une
abeille ressemble à une mouche (L’abeille ressemble à la
mouche) mais elle a un aiguillon | et elle pique très fort
quand elle est en colère</span>&mdash;or: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les abeilles ressemblent
beaucoup aux mouches, | mais elles ont un petit aiguillon,
et elles piquent fort.</span>... Or one may interpolate: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les
mouches ressemblent aux abeilles, | mais elles n’ont pas
d’aiguillon, | et elles ne piquent pas comme les abeilles.</span> It
is best not to enter upon greater deviations, because then
it will too frequently be necessary to let a pupil translate
the sentence constructed by the teacher, since otherwise it
is not certain whether the whole class has understood it or
not<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. The most important thing in these exercises, as also
in the exercises with questions (see below), is not to let
the pupil get beyond his depth so that he will become
frightened and lose confidence, for then he will never learn
to swim.</p>

<p>We have hitherto assumed that the pupils repeat what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
has been said orally; if the repetition is written, we have
<em>dictation</em>&mdash;an exercise which must not be neglected and
which can be conducted in different ways, partly parallel
with those just mentioned. The teacher can either say a
sentence or one of the boys can read it aloud; once may
be enough, but the teacher may also say it twice, or else
say it himself first and then let one of the pupils repeat it
before it is written down; it may be a sentence taken from
the reader (first stage), a sentence taken from the reader
but slightly changed (second stage), or an entirely new
piece (only for advanced students);<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the dictation may
be written on the blackboard or in copy-books (on slates);
one pupil may be occupied in the first way while the rest
of the class is occupied in the second way; sometimes the
class itself may correct the mistakes; if there is blackboard
space enough, several pupils can be writing the same
or different things at the same time. The dictation may be
required to be written with phonetical transcription (see
below) or orthographically, or one pupil may write in one
way, another in the other way, the two being afterwards
compared.</p>

<p>Finally, dictation may be used in connection with several
of the exercises which I shall suggest later. A question is
dictated, and the pupils are required to write both the
question and the answer; a sentence is dictated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
first person, which is then to be inflected in all persons, etc.
The advantages of dictation are, that it trains the pupils in
rapid and sharp comprehension of spoken words, that it
gives the teacher an effective means of testing what each
pupil has comprehended, and that the pupils generally
remember pretty well what they have once written down.
But the disadvantage of dictation, as of all written class
work, is that it consumes more time than oral exercises.
Dictation with “catches” is of course beneath the dignity
of a modern language teacher.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>


<p>I shall here deal with various kinds of exercises in
which the pupils have to say something in the foreign
language which they have not either seen in their books
or heard from someone else just a moment before. Some
of the first and easiest of these are <em>arithmetical exercises</em>.
But here I must first stop to make a remark about the
numerals in general. It is not so seldom that we find
pupils in our schools who have studied French for several
years without having become perfectly familiar with the
French numerals; they have great difficulty with dates.
What is the cause of this phenomenon? Of course the
French numerals are difficult, more difficult than the German;
but the French verbs are also more difficult than the
German, so that alone is not the reason why this class of
words troubles the pupils. No; the matter is quite simple.
Only imagine a French reader so planned that there is not
a single French adjective in the text, while English words
like “good,” “ugly,” “dazzling,” “white” are mixed in
among the French words. Would the pupils then be able
to learn the French adjectives? But is not this exactly
what is done in the case of the numerals? It makes no
difference if the French text has 1888 or “eighteen hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>dred
and eighty-eight,” in both cases the pupil has to
translate from English to French when he is reading the
passage aloud. There are scarcely any exercises at all in
translating numerals from French or in understanding
French numerals; as far as this class of words is concerned,
the very poorest method of translation is used, the
one by which the pupil is himself required to construct
expressions in the foreign language according to certain
rules, without having previously had sufficient opportunity
to see and hear how the foreigners themselves go about it.
In the home preparation we may be very sure that only
the most conscientious pupils trouble themselves to think
about how 1793 ought to be read.</p>

<p>Then here we have a point where reform is necessary
and unusually easy to bring about. Let the Arabic numerals
disappear from all text-books for beginners in a foreign
language, and then if they contain enough of numerals
written out in full&mdash;and especially if the teacher drills the
pupils a good deal in simple arithmetical exercises in the
foreign language in the manner now to be suggested&mdash;it
will be found that when the pupils are so far advanced as
to give up text-books and read literary works, they will
have no difficulty in reading all the numerals which they
happen to come across fluently and correctly.</p>

<p>Already, at a very early stage, after one or two months’
instruction, the teacher can begin with arithmetical exercises,
because they do not require any great command of
language; they not only give the pupils practice in the
numerals themselves, but also in catching the foreign words
and sounds. The question is directed, as suggested above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to the whole class, and then the teacher points out&mdash;by
name or merely by a glance&mdash;the one who is to answer it;
the answer must include the question. Thus the teacher:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Deux fois six, combien, Henri?&mdash;Henry: Deux fois six
font douze. (Répète, Jean). Trois et neuf font, Alfred?
A.: Trois et neuf font onze. T.: C’est faux, n’est-ce
pas, Louis?&mdash;Louis: Oui, trois et neuf font douze.</span>
(Or: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce correct, Louis?</span> or: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce bien ça, Louis?</span>)
In addition to this, sums may be set containing concrete
numbers, especially such as may familiarize the pupils with
the foreign coins: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux francs, combien de sous valent-ils?
trois sous, combien de centimes?</span>...; or a little rule-of-three
sum: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si une poire coûte trois centimes, combien
cinq poires?</span> Or, for instance: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux œufs à deux sous et
trois pommes à un sou, combien ça fait-il?</span> The teacher
must not be afraid of using several whole lessons for such
exercises, and afterwards he can take a few minutes of a
lesson now and then in order to keep the pupils in practice.
Since of course it is not arithmetic that is being
taught, it is best to stick to easy problems, mostly addition
and multiplication. Of course, by way of a change, one
pupil may be allowed to give a problem to another to solve.</p>

<p>The numerals may also fittingly be brought in when the
vocabulary is to be reviewed, the boys being allowed to
count with concrete numbers in a certain order, so that
each boy in turn has to think of some word which has not
previously been used during the lesson; it is often funny
to see how eager they are to outdo each other. And it
often happens that a pupil who has said Pass, suddenly
recalls a whole series of words when one of his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mentions a word from a selection which has not been
broached before; the one thought suggests another that is
associated with it. In French, the pupils must also pay
attention to the form of the numeral, which changes
according as it precedes a vowel or a consonant.</p>

<p>It very seldom happens that a boy uses a word which is
impossible after a numeral, as for instance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">venir</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonsoir</i>
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trot</i>, which indicates that he is ignorant of the word’s
signification, but then the whole class laughs of its own
accord. But it is the easiest thing in the world to hear from
the manner in which the words are said if they are really
understood; and, in case of doubt, the teacher can suddenly
ask for a translation; this is, however, generally superfluous,
for the pupils only mention words which they understand,
but still of course it is good for them to review them.</p>

<p>One of the most important exercises is to transpose a
selection which has been read into <em>questions</em> and <em>answers</em>.
The teacher can begin this rather early, but he must from
the very beginning and always strictly require the <em>pupil’s
answer to be given in the form of a complete sentence</em>.
We have no use for such an undignified performance in
which the pupil gets along bravely if only he is able to
answer all his teacher’s questions with either <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, monsieur</span>,
or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non, monsieur</span>, or some other equally intelligent answer.
As an illustration of the kind of exercise I mean, take for
instance the following one based on one of the very first
texts in my own French Reader, which runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
Enfant gâté.<br />
Veux-tu du pâté?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Non, maman, il est trop salé!<br />
Veux-tu du rôti?<br />
Non, maman, il est trop cuit!<br />
Veux-tu du jambon?<br />
Non, maman, il n’est pas bon!<br />
Veux-tu du pain?<br />
Non, maman, le pain ne vaut rien!<br />
Enfant gâté, tu ne veux rien manger,<br />
Enfant gâté, tu seras fouetté!
</div>

<p>The following questions may be based on this piece.
The pupils’ answers are given in [ ]:&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Es-tu un enfant?
[Oui, monsieur, je suis un enfant.] Es-tu un enfant
gâté? [Non, monsieur, je ne suis pas un enfant
gâté.] L’enfant gâté veut-il du pâté? [Non, monsieur, il
ne veut pas du pâté</span>; or: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’enfant gâté ne....] Veut-il
du rôti? [Non, monsieur, il ne veut pas du rôti.] Veut-il
du pain? [Non, monsieur, il ne veut pas du pain.] Veut-il
du jambon? [Non, monsieur, il ne veut pas du jambon.]
Pourquoi ne veut-il pas du pâté? [Parce que le pâté est
trop salé.] Pourquoi ne veut-il pas du jambon? [Il ne
veut pas du jambon parce qu’il n’est pas bon.] Pourquoi
ne veut-il pas du rôti? [Parce qu’il est trop cuit.]
Pourquoi ne veut-il pas du pain? [Parce que le pain ne
vaut rien.] Qu’est-ce qui est trop salé? [C’est le pâté qui
est trop salé.] Qu’est-ce qui ne vaut rien? [C’est le pain
qui ne vaut rien.] Qu’est-ce qui est trop cuit? [Le jambon
est trop cuit.] L’enfant gâté sera-t-il fouetté? [Oui, monsieur,
il sera fouetté.] Pourquoi sera-t-il fouetté? [Parce
qu’il ne veut rien manger.] Va-t-on chercher le bâton pour
taper l’enfant gâté? [Oui, monsieur, on s’en va chercher
le bâton pour venir taper l’enfant.]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that a simple little piece can suggest
a large number of questions, and it is important, especially
in the beginning, for the teachers to ask the pupils <em>as many
questions as possible</em> in order to accustom them to the
exercise, so that they may take part intelligently and fluently.
Anyone who sees all these questions in print may
think that they occupy a long time in a monotonous way;
but after a little practice, on the part of both the teacher
and the pupils, the exercise really proceeds very rapidly.
In dealing with beginners, it were best for the teacher in
formulating his questions to <em>deviate as little as possible from
the words of the text</em>, so that they can be used in the
answers almost or entirely without any change. It is not
assumed in this exercise that the pupils have committed
the piece to memory, but of course the exercise itself tends
to make them thoroughly familiar with it. In order to give
the pupils confidence, and in order not to require too
much of them immediately, the teacher can in the first few
lessons allow them to keep their books open while the
piece is gone through once in question form, so that they
can look up their answers when they cannot remember
them. Then they can be told to close their books and
answer the same or almost the same questions without
referring to the text. Of course, the first few times when
such an exercise is used, it is also well for the teacher to
direct the same question to several boys in succession; and
the very first time he can also write a few questions with
their corresponding answers on the blackboard, in order to
show the class how the exercise is to proceed.</p>

<p>Even if the pupils learn the piece by heart in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the exercise, yet their answering the teacher’s questions
does not become mechanical, since they have to consider the
form of the question, and then reflect over what is to be included
in the answer, and how it is to be worded and constructed.
Of course, the teacher ought to feel gratified if the
pupils of their own accord make slight alterations in the
words of the book, substitute a pronoun for a substantive,
etc., only it is best not to give too early encouragement to
great deviations from the text. The last question of the
above examples, which is based on a piece that has been read
before in the same book, shows how the teacher already at a
very early stage can vary a certain day’s exercise by bringing
into connection with it something previously learned. The
pupils will greet such a question with pleasure, partly
the pleasure of recognition, and partly the pleasure of the
opportunity thus afforded them to feel at home in the
language. As time goes, the teacher may depart more and
more from the material of the book. For instance, he may
use its words in asking the pupils questions about their
own personal affairs, or about things in which they are
interested outside of their French lessons. If they are having
a selection which contains the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roi</i> and the names of
various countries, the teacher may say: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment s’appelle
le roi d’Angleterre?</span> (or, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">notre roi?</span>) <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui est roi d’Espagne?</span>
etc.; yes, why not also <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment s’appelle le roi de France?</span></p>

<p>In the beginning, it is only the teacher that asks questions,
but it does not last very long before the teacher by
way of a change can allow the <em>pupils themselves to ask each
other questions</em>; thus they learn to construct sentences in
the interrogative form, which, when they come to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
practical use of the language, is just as important for them
as to be able to answer. In German schools, they have a
regular system of exercises on this plan in connection with
grammatical categories; of a given sentence in the book the
pupils are to construct first a subject-question, then a verb-question,
then an object-question, etc. If, for instance, the
sentence is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La mère de Gribouille a cassé sa marmite</i>, and
the teacher wants a subject-question, pupil A asks B: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui
a cassé la marmite?</span> (or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui est-ce qui a cassé la
marmite?</span>); or a verb-question: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’est-ce qu’a fait la mère
de Gr.?</span>; or an object-question: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que la mère de
Gr. a cassé?</span> In order to help beginners with the grammatical
difficulties, several sentences may be written on the
blackboard with their various parts differently underlined.
Later on the teacher can tell one of the pupils to change
all the sentences in a piece which has been read&mdash;of course
only in so far as they lend themselves to such a change&mdash;into,
for instance, object-questions. After each question,
the teacher points out the one who is to answer. Then
another pupil may change the same sentences (or those in
the next paragraph) into subject-questions, etc. Of course
the teacher must not put up with a mere mechanical alteration
of the text, but must always require the pupils to
exercise so much common sense that no questions are made
which would not occur in a natural conversation.</p>

<p>When the pupils themselves ask questions, they naturally
cannot do anything else but follow the text slavishly as
it stands, so therefore it is not advisable always to let <em>them</em>
ask the question; the teacher must on the whole avoid
getting into any rut. He himself must do the asking rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
frequently; he may either pounce upon some little point or
ask comprehensive questions, including the gist of several
sentences. Only he must remember that sentences which
are too comprehensive either require too much of the pupils,
or are quite empty and meaningless; besides, the result may
only be that the exercise shrinks into almost nothing, since
then there can only be two or three questions to correspond
to a whole page of the text, and thus the text cannot make
as strong and detailed an impression as it should. And,
above all, the questions must be asked as naturally as possible.</p>

<p>If this question-exercise is used and all its possibilities
for variation exhausted in the right way&mdash;with liveliness,
tact and constant consideration for the pupils’ standpoint&mdash;it
gives ample and abundant opportunities for the teacher not
only to talk to, but with, the pupils in the foreign language;
and notice that it is not “talking to the pupil in a language
which he does not yet understand”&mdash;this fear is often
expressed by those who have misgivings as to the advisability
of conversational exercises at an early stage&mdash;but from
the very beginning nothing is said which the pupil cannot
be required to understand and to answer intelligently in the
same language.</p>

<p>Quite imperceptibly the teacher may pass from this
exercise to <em>renarration</em>; the question has merely to be
formulated in such a way that it cannot be answered in a
single sentence but only by an account of the contents of
at least a few lines or so. Thus longer and longer pieces
may be required to be retold, although during the first
years it should only be such pieces as have previously been
learned and gone through in detail by means of questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and answers. Later on, the teacher can use pieces for
renarration which have not been assigned to the class for
preparation; the teacher reads aloud (or may possibly let
one of the pupils do it), if necessary, several times, and
thereupon requires as much as possible to be retold either
orally or in writing, or first orally, then in writing. Or if
there is a sufficient number of copies of the book used,
the pupils may be given say ten or twenty minutes in
which to read the piece through silently to themselves, and
then they can use the rest of the hour to write down what
they can remember of it. Such exercises are used to a large
extent in teaching the mother-tongue, and it is agreed that
they are highly beneficial, because they not only sharpen
the powers of apprehension, especially the ability to distinguish
between the essential and the unessential, but they
also develop linguistic technique, that is the formal command
of means of expression, since much of the language
used in the original creeps into the renarration and thus
becomes the possession of the reteller. Of course the
pupils are earlier ripe for such exercises in their native
language than in foreign languages, but that does not
lessen their value in the two respects mentioned, of which
the latter is the more important here, while there is perhaps
too great a tendency to attach the chief importance to the
former in the teaching of the native tongue. Even when
the pupils are far advanced, it is highly beneficial for them
to give (French, etc.) reports of something which they have
read&mdash;not merely simple renarrations of bits of fiction or
history, but also résumés of the trend of thought in some
philosophical or critical essay, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Many pieces also lend themselves to <em>reshaping</em> in various
ways, whereby grammatical relations may be practised at
the same time as the words and sentences of the selection
once more pass in review through the minds of the pupils.
All the singulars may be changed to plurals, as far as the
plurals make sense in the connection. After the piece has
been gone through in its printed form, the pupil reads it
aloud, remembering in the case of each word to consider
whether or not it has to be changed to the plural and what
it would be in the plural. Thus, according to circumstances,
there are either nouns, adjectives, pronouns or verbs to be
changed. Or what is told about a boy may be said about
a girl. Changes in time from “now” to “yesterday,” from
“to-day” to “in a week,” occasion many alterations in the
forms of the verbs, fewer in the adverbs. The person may
also be changed, especially in such a way that the pupil
puts himself in the place of that Peter about whom something
is told, and thus substitutes <i>I</i> for <i>he</i>, etc.; if desirable,
those further alterations may be made which make a letter
out of the narrative. A change from the first to the third
person can easily be combined with the shifting of tense
which gives us indirect instead of direct discourse. Thus
the following sentence: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien, Pierre, dit Jean, qu’est-ce
que tu vas faire demain? Je ne sais pas, dit Pierre</span>,”
may be changed to: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean a demandé à Pierre ce qu’il
allait faire le lendemain, et Pierre a répondu qu’il ne savait
pas (qu’il n’en savait rien).</span>” In German, this kind of
transposition involves such complicated changes (person,
mood, order of words) that they cannot be required until
at a later stage than in French; but transposition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
indirect to direct discourse is not very difficult. Changes
from the active to the passive must be undertaken with a
good deal of care, since there are comparatively few
sentences which can be thus transposed without undergoing
a shifting of meaning, which it is not always easy to explain
or understand the cause of, and many sentences do not
lend themselves to such transposition at all. Likewise
there are relatively few connected passages where negative
sentences can be made affirmative and vice versâ without
giving us sheer nonsense. So these last two kinds of
transposition can, as a rule, only be applied to single
sentences, which the teacher has to pick out of their connection;
but when carefully selected in this way they will be
found to be very useful, especially in French, where the
correct placing of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas</i> is so important; they are less
useful in German.</p>

<p>Now and then, too, dependent clauses (for instance
relative, adverbial clauses, etc.) may be changed to independent
clauses and vice versâ, and still more complicated
changes may be undertaken by which one may try the
different ways in which the thoughts of a passage may be
linked together.</p>

<p>Of course it is also possible to have mixed exercises of
this kind. For instance, pupil A reads aloud; the teacher
interrupts him at the end of a sentence, mentions what
kind of change it is to undergo, and thereupon points out
one of the other pupils (whose books are closed) who is to
make the change. But the teacher must never allow any
of these exercises to become something merely mechanical
which is turned out according to a certain fixed formula; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pupils must always be trained to consider whether a newly
constructed sentence makes sense or not; thereby both
their linguistic intuition and their powers of logic are
sharpened at the same time.</p>

<p>By this time we have fairly encroached upon the question
as to the method to be used in training pupils in the
<em>grammar</em> of a foreign language. I want to introduce my
discussion of this subject with the following quotation from
N. M. Petersen (<cite lang="da" xml:lang="da">Sprogkundskab i Norden</cite>, Collected
Works, Copenhagen, 1870, ii. 297&ndash;8):</p>

<p>“With respect to method, the artificial one must be
given up and a more natural one must take its place.
According to the artificial method, the first thing done is
to hand the boy a grammar and cram it into him piece by
piece, for everything is in pieces; he is filled with paradigms
which have no connection with each other or with
anything else in the world ... he is filled with words,
only half of which occur occasionally, and some never at
all in what he reads. How old are not the complaints over
this perverted method! how many sighs it has occasioned,
how much deformity it has produced! On the other
hand, the natural method of learning languages is by
practice. That is the way one’s native language is acquired.
The pupil becomes acquainted with the elements and
absorbs them, as it were, into his soul in their entirety
before he is consciously able to separate and account for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the single parts and their special relations; he forms whole
complete sentences without knowing which is the subject
and which the object; he gradually finds out that he has
to give each part of the sentence its correct endings without
knowing anything about tense or case.... The logical
consequence of this, then, is that as a rule one cannot
begin with grammar in teaching languages to a child of
ten or twelve. His first years at school ought to give him
merely materials; he ought to collect experiences (that is a
child’s greatest delight), but not speculate over them.”</p>

<p>It is now half a century ago since N. M. Petersen
uttered these golden words, and still the old grammar-instruction
lives and flourishes with its rigmaroles and
rules and exceptions, <em>that intensely stupid custom, the teaching
of grammar to children</em>, as Herbert Spencer calls it.
Only few of the boys in our schools who have studied
German for several years, are able to connect for instance
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">um</i> with the proper case without hesitation; but there are
certainly still fewer who cannot run through <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">durch</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">für</i>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gegen</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ohne</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">um</i> and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wider</i> like parrots. But strangely enough
this ever present phenomenon does not yet seem to have
led to a general acknowledgment of the fact that these
grammatical rigmaroles as a rule are scarcely worth as
much as the counting-out rigmaroles of the children: eeny
meeny miny mo.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>And, of course, paradigms which are learned by rote also
belong to the category of rigmaroles. “Paradigms ought
by all means to be given, but should never be learned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
heart in rigmarole-fashion.” (N. M. Petersen.) Thoughtlessness
and stupidity thrive excellently on this continual repetition
of words as words, that is words without any mutual
association, without connection in sentences. Just think of
the many thousands of boys and girls who time and again
recite: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mourir</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mourant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mort</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je meurs</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je mourus</i>, and
then ask how many of them, yes even of their teachers,
ever happen to think that the last form in reality is impossible
(at all events in conversations in this life).<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The percentage
is scarcely very large. And when conscientious
philologists like Ayer and Sachs give imperative forms like
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nais</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naissons</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naissez</i>&mdash;be born! let us be born!! be ye
born!!! it cannot be denied that we are tempted to use the
exclamation: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die gelehrten, die verkehrten!</span>” Of course
it is not our aim to get rid of such forms as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je mourus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
what is wrong is the system. I condemn <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivre</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivant</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vécu</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je vis</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je vécus</i> just as strongly as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mourir</i>, etc., even if
none of these forms is really meaningless. And the reason
why I reject this method of teaching languages is because it
does not and cannot bring us to our desired goal. The chief
absurdity, the one which it is our business to quarrel with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
is that use of disconnected words for grammatical purposes,
which flourishes in all our text-books.</p>

<p>It has often amused me to examine grown-up persons
(non-philologists) in what they could remember of the
instruction they had received in school in foreign languages.
It seems to be extremely common that they have not the
slightest idea as to what case for instance a preposition
governs, but the rigmarole in which it occurs they generally
know by heart. They also know ever so many scraps like
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der buchstabe</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der friede</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der funke</i> ... or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das amt</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das ass</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das bad</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das bild</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das blatt</i> ... but why they have learned
these things, and what they were supposed to be good for,
to these questions there is generally no answer forthcoming.
So those rigmaroles are really of no practical use whatever.</p>

<p>Now, of course, rigmaroles could easily be so arranged&mdash;though
no one seems to have put it into practice&mdash;as to
contain an indication of the object in grouping together
just those words, for instance by saying <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">durch das zimmer</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">für</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gegen</i> ... or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">durch für ... um wider mich</i>, or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das amt</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die ämter</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das ass</i> ... or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das amt</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ämter</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bäder</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bilder</i>....</p>

<p>But even in this improved form it seems to me that
grammatical rigmaroles are of little value just because they
accustom the pupils to learn and say things by rote
without <em>thinking</em>; they are remnants of the old-fashioned
would-be pedagogy where a teacher in any subject was
satisfied if the pupil only “knew his lesson,” that is, could
recite the words of the book, and where no one ever
thought about understanding or other such-like modern
inventions.</p>

<p>The expressions “living” and “dead” are so often used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
about languages and words, but those who use them do
not always take the trouble to consider in what sense these
expressions really have any meaning. A language only
lives, and can only live, in a person’s mind, and that it lives
there means that its component parts are for him associated
with certain ideas, which are recalled when he hears the
words, and which in turn summon up the corresponding
words when he wants to express them, or when he simply
wants to make them clear for himself. But ideas do not
and cannot exist except in combinations; an absolutely
isolated thought is the same as nothing. It is the same
with words; if they are taken out of their natural surroundings,
they suffer atrophy and at last cease to perform the
usual function of words, namely to produce ideas. So
isolated words, such as are given in rigmaroles and paradigms,
are only ghosts or corpses of words. Try to run
through the words “jewel, stone, cabbage, knee, owl, toys,
louse,” and see if a single complete picture has been produced
in your mind&mdash;but you are no better off when you
say the French rigmarole <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caillou</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chou</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genou</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hibou</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joujou</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pou</i>. That, as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amas</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amat</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amamus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amatis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amant</i> and all the others, must by virtue of the
fundamental psychical law of the life of language become
merely empty jingle and nothing else. Now we see the
psychological reason why sensible persons can write such
sentences in their books as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je mourus</i> or the entirely
parallel “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wir sind nicht hier.</span>” When the mind is occupied
with a word as a grammatical phenomenon, the word’s
normal power of calling forth ideas is of course lessened in
a considerable degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore the isolation of words for grammatical purposes
may even lead us to make positive mistakes. The
pupils are first carefully taught in the grammar that
“nobody” in French is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne personne</i> and “never” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne
jamais</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and later on it is corrected as a serious mistake
when they write <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne personne parlait</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il ne jamais parle</i>,
mistakes which would never have occurred if the pupils
had not been allowed to learn the false formulation. In
modern French “nobody” is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personne</i> and “never” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jamais</i>,
just as “not” is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas</i>, etc. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ne</i> only exists in connection
with a verb, and ought never to be seen or learned by the
pupils except in its natural surroundings; out of connection
it is no more a word than <i>un</i> (in <i>unfriendly</i>, <i>ungracious</i>,
etc.). The rule for its employment can be thus stated
in short, that it is placed in front of the verb, always, if the
sentence is wholly negative, also often if it is only half
negative (by which I mean the well-known cases after
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empêcher</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">craindre</i>, comparatives, etc., where <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne</i> is well on
the way to slip out of the living French language, and
where we now, after the last ministerial decrees, may allow
ourselves a little laxity in teaching these points).<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Likewise
it is only injurious to teach the children that “I” is
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je</i>, “thou” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu</i>&mdash;a matter of fact it is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moi</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toi</i>, while of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
course “I go, thou goest,” is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je vais</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu vas</i>; what usage
has joined together, let no grammar put asunder.</p>

<p>But words, when in their natural connections, show their
vitality in other ways besides in summing up the correct
ideas; they have another power, which they also lose when
they are isolated, namely the power of breeding new connections
in the image of the old ones. If I have often
reproduced a certain type of word-formation or sentence-construction,
then this becomes a part of my mental
mechanism in such a way that I unconsciously make something
new (coin a new word, construct a new sentence)
after the same pattern, after the “analogy” of what I
know, whenever I need it, just as the English boy who
has often heard superlatives like <i>hardest</i>, <i>cleanest</i>, <i>highest</i>,
etc., does not need any rule to be able to construct forms
like <i>purest</i>, <i>ugliest</i>, <i>dirtiest</i>, of his own accord, and who, at
the moment when he says them, would not be able even
by means of the most scrupulous analysis to decide if he
has heard the form often before and is merely reproducing
it, or if he himself is creating it without having previously
heard it&mdash;and, if the latter is the case, if he is
creating something which others also have created, or if it
is the very first time that the word is used in the language&mdash;this
is what takes place every minute wherever human
languages are spoken.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> An Englishman has so often
heard (and repeated) sentences like “give the man your
hand,” “I gave the boy a whipping,” “he gave his sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
an apple,” that he unconsciously forms his sentences
according to a scheme where the indirect object always
precedes the direct object, and which even without this
grammatical terminology and without any rule would lead
him quite naturally to say, for instance, “Will you give
your father the money?” A Frenchman would just as
instinctively say, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Veux-tu donner cet argent à ton père?</span>”
because in all the sentences which he has experienced he
has heard the “dative” expressed by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à</i> after the direct
object.</p>

<p>But since this takes place by virtue of inviolable
psychical laws, it applies not only to the mother-tongue,
but also to the foreign languages which we learn later.
We simply cannot avoid thus unconsciously forming types
or patterns to go by, in using a foreign language, as soon
as the conditions for these typical formations are at hand.
If, on learning English, a Dane has frequently heard (read)
and (especially) used combinations like <i>up here</i>, <i>in here</i>, <i>in
there</i>, <i>out there</i>, then he will quite naturally say <i>down there</i>
when he wants to express this thought; it is not at all
necessary for him previously to have learned a rule to the
effect that “<i>here</i> and <i>there</i> in connection with other adverbs
of place stand last.” As a matter of fact, when we
speak or write a foreign language, we employ a number of
such rules which we have never seen formulated, and,
what is more, also rules which have never at any time been
consciously formulated by any grammarian. The reason
why we cannot attain the same confidence in all departments
of the foreign language that we feel in our native
language is of course partly because the conditions are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
so favourable, and partly because our mother-tongue acts
as a hindrance on account of the tendency it has to intrude
on all occasions and mislead us to construct sentences
after <em>its</em> pattern.</p>

<p>But the conditions become the more favourable for this
unconscious mental activity in our pupils the more we
know how to make each sentence in the foreign language
have its full effect upon them and become their possession,
and the more we can keep the mother-tongue in the
background. And although we can never bring it about
that our pupils come across the forms in the foreign language
even approximately as often as that child does who
is learning his native language, yet we can to a large extent
make amends for this by bringing a better system into our
teaching, so that the acquiring of the language will not
depend so much upon chance as is the case when babies
learn to talk, just as it is also an advantage that our pupils
are older and more developed, and that we can get some
help from the written and printed language.</p>

<p>Many of the transposition exercises mentioned in the
last section are essentially grammatical, but we can easily hit
upon still more exercises by which we may in a systematic
way encourage the natural tendency toward type- and
series-formations. To conjugate a verb all the way
through by itself is the sheerest drudgery, but the exercise
immediately becomes both more interesting and more
beneficial when it is a whole sentence that is to be tackled.
For instance, the teacher can write on the blackboard a
sentence like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je donne un sou à Alfred</span>” and get the
pupils to conjugate it through all the persons. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
beginning he might also write down all the forms of the
verb, one under the other; they are not to be committed to
memory, but merely furnish a scheme, which the pupils are
to fill out by inserting the correct pronouns before, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
sou à Alfred</i> after the verb. Then the next step is to let
the pupils use other words instead of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un sou</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alfred</i>, so
that pupil A says, for instance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je donne un centime à Paul</i>.
B: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu donnes un franc à Jean</i>. C: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il donne un livre à
papa</i>. D: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous donnons des poires à l’épicier</i>, etc. Then in
reality the task which the boys have before them is to hit
upon new words to insert (they must make sense!); consequently
it becomes a kind of game in which the
vocabulary is reviewed like the one mentioned above
(p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>), but at the same time the forms of the verb
are practised. If a pupil should happen to say, for
instance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ils donnent deux cerises à le maître</i>, the teacher
must only say the sentence himself with the correct <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au</i> and
make him repeat it in this form without scolding him,&mdash;yes,
even without stopping to give a long explanation of why it
should be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au</i> and not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à le</i> in this case. This kind of
exercise can of course be varied in different ways; such a
sentence as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon père me donne de l’argent</i> is written down,
and the pupils are told to inflect it in all the persons, which
of course only involves an alteration of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">me</i>; or the
sentence is to be reconstructed with other tenses, etc.
More complicated sentences, too, may be conjugated all
the way through, either without changing anything but the
pronouns and the forms of the verbs, as for instance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je
suis allé me promener avec mon père</i>; <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das habe ich ihm
gestern versprochen, und ich werde es ihm morgen geben</i>&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in such a way that other things are changed too: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je
m’appelle</i> ... where the pupil is to insert real names
(his own, a comrade’s ... in case it is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous</i>, the
teacher’s); <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich habe meinen vater um etwas brot gebeten.</i>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du hast deinen vater um etwas geld gebeten.</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Er hat seinen
vater um ein stück papier gebeten.</i> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sie hat ihren vater um
einen kuchen gebeten</i>, etc. Of course one can also assign
written exercises of a similar kind, as for instance: construct
five sentences like <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Le père</i> de <i>Jean</i> est allé à la
maison de <i>sa sœur</i></span>, using different words in each sentence
in place of those here italicized, etc., etc.; but it were best
if these sentences were suggested by, or in some way
associated with, sentences in the text-book.</p>

<p>Now some people will say that this is only another way
of employing those grammatical isolated sentences which I
have declaimed against&mdash;and they are right in so far as I
admit that the more the exercises are made to resemble
the old-fashioned ones, the poorer they are for the purpose,
and if they are employed to too great an extent they may
easily degenerate into tiresome mechanical routine-work.
But if used to moderation they will only be beneficial, and
then, besides, they differ from the single sentences of the
old method in being associated with a text which has been
read, so they are not thus quite isolated from a sensible
connection; they also differ because translation is not used
and is not needed (except when the teacher at long
intervals has to make sure that pupil A has understood a
sentence given by pupil C, who has used an unusual word);
they differ because, translation being omitted, the whole
exercise can proceed at a rapid pace; they differ because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the sentences are constructed by the pupils themselves,
who are thus compelled all the time to pay attention both
to their form and contents; and finally they differ because,
as a result of all this, they are more interesting and
amusing to the pupils. Furthermore such exercises incite
the pupils to want to say something of their own accord,
and thus they get a desire to extend their knowledge; they
will frequently ask what this or that word which they need
in a sentence is in French or German&mdash;and in that case
the teacher must always answer, but then he must always
require, too, that they <em>learn</em> the word which has been
given them (to prevent them from getting into the habit of
asking superficially and carelessly just “for the fun of it”).
Finally the pupils will thus be brought to appreciate the
benefit of learning grammar; their grammatical knowledge
is not sheer theory for them, but is continually converted
into effective power and thus becomes easier to remember,
for there is no doubt that Goethe is right when he says:
“Still all that we can remember of our studies in the end
is only what we have been able to find practical use for.”</p>

<p>Of course, the sentences constructed by the pupils in the
course of any one of the exercises recommended in this
book may contain mistakes, and the most serious mistakes
must be corrected, yet with as little particularity as possible,
if they have nothing to do with the phenomenon
which is being or just has been carefully considered and
practised, and with as few theoretical reasons as possible.
Many exercises can be so arranged that it is scarcely possible
for the pupils to make any mistake, and this without
becoming less valuable; on the contrary, they will often be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the best, for every sentence which a pupil constructs or says
correctly confirms good habits of language. But no matter
how much one may favour the theory that “Prevention is
better than cure,” it is not well to be too anxious to prevent
mistakes. One of the ablest advocates of the reform
in Germany, Wendt, says: “It is of more importance for
the pupil to talk at all than to talk correctly,” and although
I know what criticism I have to expect from unsympathetic
opponents about my encouraging superficiality and not
caring a bit about correctness, yet I cannot deny myself
the pleasure of quoting with approbation a Slavic proverb,
<i lang="sh" xml:lang="sh">Tko zeli dobro govoriti mora natucati</i> (whoever wants
to speak well must murder the language), which
Schuchardt has chosen as a motto for his stimulating work
about mixed languages,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and which he interprets: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer
aus irgend einem grunde sich scheut eine fremde sprache
zu misshandeln, der werd sie nie beherrschen.</span>”</p>

<p>In order to reassure people who cannot help feeling
anxious, I shall add here three statements from the report
of the ninth German “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neuphilologentag</span>” (1901). Klinghardt
(p. 100) confesses that he has been converted to the
reform, because, in spite of years of vigorous efforts, he had
not succeeded by means of the translation method<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in
training the majority of his pupils to grammatical correctness.
Headmasters of schools where the old method was
employed had also told him that there were still serious
grammatical mistakes of form in the written exercises which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
were handed in at the final examinations. But, after he had
given up the translation procedure, all of his pupils, even
the backward ones, had attained to grammatical correctness.
Wendt (p. 101) emphatically denied that anything
could be gained in grammatical sureness by translation
exercises. And Walter (p. 102) repudiated the accusation
which is always on the tongue of many of the opponents of
reform, that the reformers entirely do away with grammar,
by referring to many of these very gentlemen, who, on
visiting his school, had expressed surprise at the grammatical
sureness displayed by his pupils.</p>

<p>And since I now seem to be in the mood for quotations,
I can also refer to Goethe’s words: “Thus I had learned
Latin, just like German, French, English, only through
practice, without rule and without system. Anyone who
knows what the state of school instruction was at that time
will not find it strange that I neglected the grammar as
well as the rhetoric; everything seemed to come naturally
to me. I retained the words, their formations and transformations
in my ear and in my mind, and I employed the
language with ease for writing and talking.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In giving the pupil English sentences to translate into
the foreign language, we are only artificially creating difficulties.
If it is difficult for the pupil to translate into his
mother-tongue where at least confirmed habit ought to
prevent him from falling into the worst pitfalls, then it must
be much more difficult, indeed impossible, to translate into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
a foreign language where he is not yet quite at home. We
ourselves lead the pupil to make mistakes, and then we
have to do all we can to prevent his confronting us with a
too overwhelming number of them. To this end we limit
each exercise to illustrating one, or two, or three, paragraphs
in the grammar; we make theoretical rules to serve
as a guide in translating, without always remembering how
difficult it is to make practical use of such rules; we bracket
the words which are not to be translated; we try to be
helpful by placing alongside of, or underneath, the correct
English, some very strange English indeed, which, however,
has the advantage that it can be translated literally, etc.,
etc. And the result of all this exertion? Well, it is a well
known fact that they are not always things of beauty that
we meet with in the French exercises which are handed in
after many years of toil, according to this method. Experience
is sure to teach us that this is not the means to our
end. Joh. Storm is right when he says (<cite lang="da" xml:lang="da">Franske taleövelser</cite>,
Preface): “The worst and most unfruitful torment in the
school instruction of the present time is the excessive use
of written exercises in foreign languages.” As a bright
contrast to this “constructive” method of procedure, we
have the “imitative” method, which may be so called
partly because it is an imitation of the way in which a child
learns his native language, partly because it depends upon
that invaluable faculty, the natural imitative instinct of the
pupils, to give them the proper linguistic feeling, if it
only has ample opportunity to come into play. As a
motto for this method, we might perhaps say: Away with
lists and rules. Practise what is right again and again!</p>

<p>“But our pupils must not only know their foreign languages
unconsciously and mechanically; they must not
only learn how to express themselves, but they must also
know why.” When I think of the instruction in grammar
that has been usual hitherto, I am tempted to say as if in
echo, “Why?”</p>

<p>In a school in Copenhagen, the story goes that a certain
teacher after having asked about the gender of the French
substantive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mort</i> and then “Why?” got the answer,
“Because it comes from Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors</i>, which is feminine”;
he was not satisfied with that, however, but made the
correction: “No, it is because it is an exception.” When
we feel scandalized at this teacher’s stupidity, we ought
conscientiously to ask ourselves if many of the answers
given to the question “Why?” in grammar teaching are in
reality much more valuable than this one; the object in
most cases is merely to classify the sentences or words
under certain given rubrics and to give their names and
the respective rules which have been committed to memory,
something which can in large part be done with very little
real grammatical understanding of the language in question.</p>

<p>The usual superstition that theoretical instruction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
grammar is the best way to teach pupils how to express
themselves grammatically is of a piece with the severity
with which grammatical mistakes are criticized in comparison
with the mildness with which mistakes of vocabulary,
etc., are treated.</p>

<p>That grammatical propositions are abstractions, which
are often difficult even for experts to understand, and which
must therefore be far beyond the horizon of our pupils, we
see from the way in which most philologists, on coming
across a rule which is the least bit involved, immediately
have to resort to the examples to see what the point is; we
also see it from the difficulty which grammarians often find
in expressing their rules in such a way as to be really clear.
Therefore there is even among persons who have to any
extent studied languages theoretically (and perhaps most
among them) a great tendency to avoid as much as possible
the traditional, grammatical, theoretical method when they
want to take up a new language; this feeling has been
clearly expressed by the renowned Romance scholar H.
Schuchardt.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is true, as has been said, that one really
cannot begin to learn the grammar of a language until one
knows the language itself.</p>

<p>In contrast to our school-days, when in all subjects a
ready-made system was pounded into us, and it was only
through the system that we caught sight of some of the
facts upon which it was built, so that we indulged in only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
extremely little of anything like independent observation or
classification of observations, in contrast to all this, another
method of procedure is coming to the front in all teaching,
a method which starts out from the things which the child
itself can see in its surroundings, a method which trains the
child to observe, to classify its observations, to draw its
own conclusions, so that finally, when the time is ripe, the
scientific system will raise itself, as it were, in a natural
way on the foundation of the observations made. The
golden rule is: “Never tell the children anything that they
can find out for themselves.”</p>

<p>Theoretical grammar ought not to be taken up too
early, and when it is taken up it is not well to do it in such
a way that the pupil is given ready-made paradigms and
rules. After the manner of Spencer’s “Inventional
Geometry,” where the pupil is all the way through led to
find out the propositions and proofs for himself, we ought
to get an <cite>Inventional Grammar</cite>. When a selection in the
reader has been read, the pupils may be asked to go
through it again (read it aloud), and pay special attention,
for instance, to the personal pronouns; every time one
occurs, it is to be written down on the blackboard; there
the forms are finally classified (by the pupils!) according to
the natural associations between them, and thus the paradigms
are constructed quite naturally; then, if desired, the pupils
can copy them down in special note-books for future
reference. For instance, if the French possessive pronoun
is found in the two forms <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa</i>, in the combinations
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa main</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son gant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son épée</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son ennemi</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa figure</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa blessure</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son opinion</i>, the object of the pupils must be to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the principle of usage. It will not be found difficult
to formulate a rule in these cases; but, if necessary, the
teacher can help the pupils not a little by means of the
emphasis with which he reads the sentences in which the
forms are found. Then the rule once formulated may be
tested on other forms to see if the same principle of usage
should happen to apply there too, etc.</p>

<p>Of course the teacher must decide beforehand<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> what
points of grammar a certain text is especially fitted to illustrate
in this manner. Yet it is not necessary for all the
forms which it is desired to group together to occur in the
piece which is being examined; if there are any empty
spaces in the paradigms, the pupils will of their own accord
desire to get them filled out, and they will thus have an
opportunity to learn something new. It will also frequently
happen that the missing forms are already familiar to the
pupils from previous reading; in that case, if the pupils
themselves do not happen to think of them, the teacher
can easily give them a clue by saying the beginning of the
sentence in which they occur.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>It follows as a matter of course that only the most
elementary things can be so examined in a text of one or
two pages that grammatical rules or a tolerably adequate
paradigm can be formulated. In dealing with beginners
the teacher must not be too ambitious to get, for instance,
all the forms of a verb collected in that manner, at all
events not all at once; it is not necessary; one tense at a
time is quite sufficient. And of course one must not be
such a slave of traditional grammatical systems, that one
necessarily must go all the way through one class of words
before beginning another, etc. There is no reason why
these bits of system should not be taken up quite unsystematically,
one day a little about pronouns, another day the
present tense of verbs, a third day the comparison of
adjectives, etc., all according to what comes natural, or
what the texts give occasion for.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> And it will not matter
if some time is allowed to pass between these exercises.
One of the abominations of the old method of instruction
was that the teacher, as a Swedish author has expressed it,
considered it his duty on all occasions to feel the grammatical
pulse of the pupils.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>A teacher in English can, at a rather early stage, set to
work in this way to examine and formulate the use of
English <i>do</i> as an auxiliary verb. A rather long piece
which has been read is assigned to the pupils in parts, so
that A and B get the first page, C and D the next, etc.,
and they are to find and note down all the cases which
occur. Then the cases found are gone through in the
class in such a way that the teacher first requires all those
sentences to be read aloud where <i>do</i> occurs and there is no
negation. After some sentences have been read, he may
ask what they have in common; if no one answers, more
sentences may be taken until someone discovers that
all the sentences are interrogative, and then this discovery
may be tested in the following sentences. Thereupon the
negative sentences which were before omitted are gone
through. Is it then necessary to have <i>do</i> in all questions,
and in all negative sentences? Well, go through the same
pages again for next time and note down all the cases of
interrogative and negative sentences where <i>do</i> does not
occur. Then in the next lesson we shall finally be able to
formulate the rules. This takes longer than to learn the
rule in a grammar. Yes, but then we may also be certain
that it will be far better understood and remembered, to
say nothing of the pleasure it always gives to discover
something oneself; it has all of it been a little preliminary
practice in scientific methods of research and drawing of
conclusions. And then&mdash;what I always return to&mdash;the
whole exercise has also been a review of a number
of sentences, and there is not much danger that
the pupils will forget the words, turns of expression and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
grammatical relations which they have become intimate
with in this manner.</p>

<p>Even if we do not attain to any results that can stand
comparison with the rules in our text-books, yet such lessons
in grammatical observation and systematization are none
the less valuable. For instance, the last three or four days’
German lesson may be gone through with special attention
given to the gender. One pupil reads aloud; every time he
comes to a substantive, he mentions one of his class-mates
(or the teacher motions to one of them), who is to give
the gender,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> as well as the reasons for his inference (the form
of the article in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">in der kirche</i>, the termination of the adjective
in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein schönes mädchen</i>, etc.); one of the boys stands
at the blackboard, which is divided into three columns, and
writes down each word in the right column, after its gender
is determined. When the form or the context does not
show the gender, the teacher asks if the word is familiar
from previous passages, and if the gender could be seen
there; otherwise the teacher will have to say what gender
it is. At last (toward the end of the lesson, or when
the blackboard is full), all the words are repeated
together with the article; then, if it seems fit, the teacher
may examine one or another pupil, letting him stand with
his back to the blackboard. If there are, for instance, two
or three words ending in <i>ung</i> or <i>schaft</i> or some other
absolutely certain ending, the pupils may be asked to recall
other words with the same ending, and then formulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rule for themselves. A few hours employed in this
manner will surely bear much more fruit than if all the
long rules for gender with their exceptions and exceptions
to exceptions were committed to memory; the attention is
roused and the powers of observation are sharpened, so that
the pupils will also in the future take note of the gender of
new words, when there is anything to indicate it, especially
since it is necessary for them to know the gender of the
words which they need in the conversation and transposition
exercises already described in this book.</p>

<p>Difficult, especially syntactical, phenomena which do not
occur very frequently, cannot be treated exactly in this way,
but some of them may be taken up in an analogical manner.
During the going over of a large section of the French reader,
the attention may, for instance, be directed to the subjunctive,
so that each subjunctive form is either written down in a
notebook or marked in the margin of the reader; after one
or two weeks or so, all these sentences may be collected
and arranged in large groups. During the next week,
similar cases are frequently met with, and the pupil is given
an opportunity to recall his recent observations, and perhaps
supplement them by newly discovered varieties of subjunctive
clauses, etc. But it must be continually borne in
mind that much of what is found in grammars is really of
no value except to the philological specialist, and should
never be learned by schoolboys.</p>

<p>A systematical grammar is not superfluous except in
the first stage. Later on its examples may be used to supplement
those collected in the course of the reading; the
teacher can, for instance, read them aloud, make sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they are understood, and use them to help the pupils to
find out the rule. Then, when the pupils have formulated
the rule as well as they can, it may be read as rendered in
the grammar. To go through the grammar from one end
to the other, a section at a time, ought not to be undertaken
until most of the phenomena have been treated in
connexion with the reading; it will then be both easier
and more interesting than if taken up earlier; its chief use
will then be to fill out and confirm what has already been
learned.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>If grammar is taught in this way, the pupils will not get
that feeling which they now so frequently have, that they are
just learning a series of arbitrarily prescribed instructions
as to how they are to avoid making mistakes and getting
“poor marks” in their written exercises; they are more apt
to conceive of it as something to be compared to the laws
of nature, those general comprehensive observations of
what takes place under certain conditions; for grammar is
made up of observations of the manner in which the natives
express themselves. The pupils no longer say to themselves:
“We <em>must</em> have the subjunctive in purpose clauses
for it stands in § 235,” but “we find the subjunctive in all
purpose clauses.” The teacher’s chief task is to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
pupils insight into the construction of the foreign language,
into its peculiarities and the chief points in which it
deviates from other languages. As a rule, text-books dwell
too much on details, and often neglect very important
features, such as for instance the great freedom allowed
in English in the use of substantives as verbs and vice-versâ,
the different part played by order of words in the
different languages, the cause and effect relationship
between a fixed order of words and paucity of case-endings,
etc.</p>

<p>The usual arrangement of grammatical material is not as
shrewd as it might be. The sharp division between accidence
and syntax as we find it in most of our text-books
is, from a scientific point of view, untenable and
impracticable<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; from a pedagogical point of view it is unfortunate,
because it separates form and function, which
ought to be learned together, just as well as a word’s
exterior (its sounds and spelling), and its meaning are
learned together.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And within each of these two parts of
the grammar, the usual order of procedure depends upon a
meaningless order of precedence between the classes of
words, whereby the adverbs are placed about as far as possible
from the adjectives, though if there are any two
classes of words which ought to belong together, they are
these two, which have comparison in common. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
case of the verbs, those things are often grouped together
which belong together lexically but not grammatically.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The translation-method is injurious here too, because it
veils contours which ought to be sharp. For instance, the
pupils will not get the proper conception of gender and its
relation to expressions for sex, if <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">er</i> referring to <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der hut</i> and
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sie</i> referring to <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die bank</i>, and likewise <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il</i> referring to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
chapeau</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle</i> referring to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la chaise</i>, are all translated by
the English <i>it</i>, while the same pronouns, when used about
persons, are translated by <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>.</p>

<p>Comparisons between the languages which the pupils
know, for the purpose of showing their differences of
economy in the use of linguistic means of expression, will
only be a natural outcome of this systematized occupation
with the theory of the language, and may often become
very interesting, especially for advanced students. (Comparisons
between the reflexive pronouns in the different
languages; <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">du ihr Sie sie</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toi vous vous ils elles eux</span>&mdash;you
you you they&mdash;il y a, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">es giebt</span>, there is, etc.). The
teacher may call attention to the inconsistency of the
languages; what is distinctly expressed in one case is in
another case not designated by any outward sign (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">haus
häuser; häuschen häuschen</span>&mdash;house houses; sheep sheep&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval
chevaux; vers vers</span>&mdash;yes in reality also <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison,
maisons</span>, etc.; <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">mich mir, dich dir, sich sich; der mann, die
frau, das weib; ein guter mann, eine gute frau, ein
gutes weib; der gute mann, die gute frau, das<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gute weib; die männer, die frauen, die weiber; die
guten m., f., w.,</span> etc.). In French and English, there
is ample occasion to point out how differently the grammatical
relations present themselves in sound and on paper
(singular and plural alike in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon bons, beau beaux, hideux
hideux</span>, further <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amer amère, clair claire, révolutionnaire
révolutionnaire</span> | church churches, judge judges | sin sinned,
fine fined | say said, lay laid, etc.). That this may be a
good way to make a beginning in comparative philology
scarcely needs further proof; many things belonging to this
field of study can be understood by our advanced pupils,
and ought to belong to a good general education. Everyone
who has received a little more than the most ordinary
school education ought to understand what is meant by
the relationship and development of languages; he ought
to be acquainted with such linguistic phenomena as the loss
of sounds, assimilation, analogical formations, differentiations,
etc.; he ought to have noticed examples of these
phenomena, both in his mother tongue and in the foreign
languages which he has learned, just as he ought to realize
how these processes continually influence the whole construction
of the languages, and, in the course of time, have
produced such great differences as those he sees between
German and English, or between Latin and French; a
valuable point of departure would be to take up the fate of
French loan-words in English with the frequent retention
of the old French sounds (<i>ch</i> in <i>chase</i>, <i>j</i> in <i>journal</i>, <i>n</i> in
<i>cousin</i> <i>cousine</i>, <i>s</i> in <i>beast</i>, <i>feast</i>, etc.). But however interesting
and valuable these things are, it is scarcely advisable to
devote too much time to them as long as the living lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>guages
have so few hours at their disposal. How much or
how little of this sort of thing the teacher takes up will
also, to a great extent, depend upon whether the class on
the whole is ripe for it, and if the pupils show sufficient
interest and desire to ask questions; very much philology
ought not to be <em>forced</em> upon them.</p>

<p>Exercises in systematization need not be limited to the
field of grammar; the lexical side of the language may also
be taken up in a similar manner, even if to a less extent.
Several methods of reviewing vocabulary have been mentioned
above, but there are still more ways; for instance
the teacher may give the pupil a certain subject (the
human body, war, a railway journey) about which he is to
collect all the words and expressions which he can remember&mdash;or
which occurred in the last narrative read&mdash;and he
may also arrange them in various subdivisions. This can
best be done in the form of a written exercise.</p>

<p>The pupils may also be set to separate a complex event
or series of actions, etc., into its single component parts.
For instance, they may describe the process of getting
dressed in all its details, or the way to school in the morning.
The more detailed the pupils can make their
descriptions, the better; they thus get use for a number not
only of substantives but especially of verbs in their natural
connection, which they see before them in their “mind’s
eye”&mdash;but I scarcely think that Gouin’s ideas<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> ought to be
used for more than such occasional series.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>Advanced students may also be instructed in a systematic
collecting of the most important synonyms. Each one
should have a special note-book for the purpose, where a
whole page is given to each group of synonyms which the
teacher wants them to treat; on this page they write down
all those sentences where they come across the word in
question. Now and then the teacher and the class together
may examine all the sentences which have been collected
and try to establish the difference between the synonyms
on the basis of the examples found. Of especial value are
of course those sentences where several synonyms occur
directly after each other (How much of <i>history</i> we have in
the <i>story</i> of Arthur is doubtful. What is not very thrilling
as <i>story</i> may be of profound interest as <i>history</i>. Half a
<i>loaf</i> is better than no <i>bread</i>. A nice little <i>loaf</i> of brown
<i>bread</i>). It will also be of interest occasionally to draw up
comparative tabular lists from different languages as for
<span class="lock">instance&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Such tables will do more than long explanations to illustrate
the differences between the languages, and to show
how often words are ambiguous and vague in meaning. It
is evident, however, that many of the subtle and fanciful
indications of shades of meaning found in the dictionaries
of synonyms are entirely beyond the grasp of ordinary pupils.</p>

<p>Dr. Walter, in Frankfurt, has still another way of furthering
his pupils’ familiarity with the resources of the foreign
language; he dictates some of the sentences from what has
been read, and lets the pupils themselves find as many
different ways as possible of expressing the same thought.
I shall reprint one of the sentences from his book, together
with the pupils’ variants (marked with letters); they were
written down in the course of 25 minutes: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ohne
vorausgegangene besprechung</span>” (in the second year of
instruction, with, so far as I know, six hours a week); as
will be seen, the variations are rather considerable.</p>

<p>I have myself, in teaching advanced pupils, in a similar
way, let them re-write a half a page or so of a historical
work. It has always interested them, and the comparison
of the results, which often presented the most varied
expressions for the same thought, was always very
instructive.</p>

<p>Parallel with the reading of a grammar as a supplement
to, and a summary of all the grammatical knowledge which
has been gained in the ways suggested, it might seem to be
a good plan to go through a systematical collection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lexical material&mdash;of course not an ordinary dictionary,
since the alphabetical arrangement is about as unsystematical
as possible, but a sensibly arranged vocabulary,
something in the line of Roget’s <cite>Thesaurus</cite>. But it ought,
at any rate, to be much smaller, and only include words
and expressions which are actually necessary; even then,
however, the unavoidable dryness of such a book, and the
absence of connection between the single words, would
make it unfit for use in teaching, even if it were not to be
employed in imparting new material, but only to recall
words which have already been learned. It would be
better worth while for pupils, who have reached a somewhat
advanced stage, to go through a little systematic collection
of phrases, especially of such turns of expression as
play a great part in ordinary daily intercourse, but which
are seldom met with in literature. Franke’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Phrases de tous
les jours</cite> is the best specimen I know of&mdash;but I have it
from the very best source that this little book was never
intended as a text-book for beginners.</p>

<p>Here, last but not least, comes the treatment of the <em>pronunciation</em>,
which for several reasons I have not taken up
first, although the questions which are here to be discussed
necessarily play a part already from the very first lesson in
a foreign language. I have now for many years advocated
the use of phonetics&mdash;yes, even of phonetical transcription,
in the teaching of foreign languages, and have to a large
extent put my theories into practice both in dealing with
children of all ages and with grown persons. New things
always frighten people; they think with terror that here
the pupils are to be burdened with an entirely new and
difficult science and with a new kind of writing; we had
trouble enough with the old kind, they say, and now we
are to be bothered with this new alphabet with its
barbarous letters! Every educator must see how objectionable
it is; now we have learned languages for so many
years without such modern inventions, and the old way
ought to be good enough for us still.</p>

<p>That is about the run of the objections raised. This
the answer: Phonetics is a science, to be sure, and, like all
other sciences, it is not without its difficult and mooted
points. Yet the fact that large volumes can be written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
about botany does not frighten us from teaching our
children <em>some</em> botany. In mathematics there are many
things which are beyond the comprehension of ordinary
school-children, but yet they have to learn <em>some</em>
mathematics. Phonetics is not a new study that we want
to add to the school curriculum; we only want to take
as much of the science as will really be a positive help in
learning something which has to be learned <em>anyway</em>. We
must remember what science is, and what part it plays.
Of course in our days every science collects more and
more material and requires more and more specialization,
so that parts of it become quite inaccessible for all persons
except the specialists themselves; but the whole idea of
science is that it shall be <em>unified knowledge</em> (Spencer), a
summing up of all the numerous details of reality under
large, comprehensive points of view, the establishing of
great, general laws, which apply to all single cases. That
is also why science can be termed “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ökonomie des denkens</span>,”
and that is why science can suggest means of
facilitating thought and the acquirement of knowledge.
We want to have some phonetics introduced into our
schools, because theory has convinced us, and experiment
has proved to us, that by means of this science we can,
with decidedly greater certainty, and in an essentially
easier way, give an absolutely better pronunciation in a
much shorter space of time than would be possible without
phonetics.</p>

<p>And as for that hobgoblin called phonetical transcription&mdash;well,
it is no “new alphabet,” not even as new as
the Gothic (German) letters are, and much less so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
than the Greek alphabet, with which the pupils are
burdened (without their being of the slightest use<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>), to
say nothing of the new names for the letters. In learning
Greek the pupils have to operate with thirty odd new
symbols; in our phonetical transcription for school use, we
do not need more than from five to eight new symbols for
each language; otherwise it consists of the ordinary letters,
and every letter in it retains one of its familiar values,
which is used consistently everywhere, the new symbols
being mostly modifications of the known letters; ʃ
reminds us of s, ʒ of z, ɛ and ə of e, ŋ of n. The whole
thing is no worse than that.</p>

<p>If you refer to your experience in opposition to these
new ways of teaching, you only invite the answer: Yes,
your experience shows how a <em>poor</em> pronunciation may be
learned!</p>

<p>Why must we learn how to pronounce the foreign
languages at all? Well, in the first place, it must be
because there is the possibility that we may meet natives
some time later. Otherwise we might, perhaps, be satisfied
with <em>reading</em> the foreign words according to English principles
of pronunciation, French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pain</i> like English “pain,”
Werther as “worth her,” etc. I have known old parsons
who have taught themselves English so as to be able
to read novels, and who read English with Danish
vowels, pronounced the <i>k</i> in <i>knight</i>, etc. For a superficial
“getting the gist” of shilling shockers and penny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
dreadfuls, this is sufficient perhaps, but I maintain that
for a penetrating, delicate comprehension of real works
of literature this manner of reading is not enough. Language
cannot be separated from sound, and that is the sum of the
matter; only he who hears the foreign language within himself
in exactly or approximately the same way as a native
hears it can really appreciate and enjoy not only poetry,
where phonetic effects must needs always play an important
part, but also all the higher forms of prose. Then there is the
mnemonic benefit of a correct pronunciation. It helps the
pupil to keep foreign languages distinct from each other;
for instance, he will never be misled to think that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune</i>
means “pretty” on account of its resemblance to <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schön</i>,
and he will not be apt to confuse French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joli</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">journée</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelle</i>
with English <i>jolly</i>, <i>journey</i>, <i>novel</i>. In the second
place, Madvig is right&mdash;and this applies to the living
languages too&mdash;when he writes: “Finally there is scarcely
any doubt that progress in the dead languages would
become more rapid if, so far as possible, for instance,
through reading and pronouncing distinctly and through
memorizing new expressions, the language came not only
through the eye, but more through the ear than it does in
most places now.”</p>

<p>Our pronunciation according to the old school is
extremely poor, indeed, much more frightful than most
people imagine. It has among others these two disadvantages,
that we do not understand the natives, and that
we are not understood by them.</p>

<p>The very first lesson in a foreign language ought to be
devoted to initiating the pupils into the world of sounds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
if the class has already had such an elementary course in
sounds, either in connection with the study of their mother
tongue (something we ought to come to in the course of
time at any rate), or in connection with another foreign
language, it can of course be made briefer; it is scarcely
safe to omit it entirely. The conversation may be formed
as simply as the following one, where all scientific terms
are avoided; not even the word “organ” is necessary.
(Of course the answers will not always be as prompt and
decided as here, and much will need to be repeated several
times with different pupils.)</p>

<p>Teacher: John, can you say <i>papa</i>? Papa.&mdash;How do
you go about it? Say it once more.&mdash;<i>Papa.</i> First, I open
my mouth, and then I open it once again.&mdash;Yes, and in
the meantime you must, of course, have closed it. Look
at me, all of you, and see if I too go about it in that way&mdash;<i>Papa</i>.
What did I do, William?&mdash;First you opened your
mouth, then closed it, then opened it again.&mdash;What did I
close it with?&mdash;With the lips.&mdash;Now, when I say <i>op</i>, <i>ap</i>, <i>ep</i>,
what do I do?&mdash;Close the lips every time, and then open
them again.&mdash;Then I do that every time I say <i>p</i>. Robert,
can you find any other sounds where I also close my lips?
No.&mdash;Try the word <i>mama</i>.&mdash;Yes, in <i>m</i>.&mdash;Now, say <i>baby</i>
and <i>bib</i>.&mdash;Also in <i>b</i>.&mdash;Good; then we have three sounds
now where the lips are closed, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>. Let us write them
in a row on the blackboard. Is it necessary to close the
lips in all sounds?&mdash;No.&mdash;What is your name?&mdash;John
Gordon Hunter.&mdash;All of you look at him while he says it.
John Gordon Hunter.&mdash;Did he close his lips at all? No.&mdash;Then
all the sounds which are in the whole of his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
must be said with other parts of the mouth than the lips.
What else have we that we use to speak with?&mdash;The
tongue.&mdash;Now, when we say <i>n</i>, for instance, <i>John</i>, <i>Anna</i>,
what do we do?&mdash;Close with the tongue behind the teeth.&mdash;What
part of the tongue?&mdash;The point.&mdash;Now try <i>t</i> in
<i>atta</i>.&mdash;There we also close with the point of the tongue
behind the teeth. And <i>d</i> in <i>adda</i>.&mdash;Likewise.&mdash;Then we
use the point of the tongue for <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>n</i>. Let us write them
down under <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>. Now <i>k</i> in <i>akka</i>?&mdash;Look into my mouth.
What do I do?&mdash;You close with the tongue farther back
in the mouth.&mdash;Yes, we call that the back of the tongue.
Howard, look into Edward’s mouth while he says <i>akka</i>.
Now <i>g</i> in <i>agga</i> (the sound <i>g</i>, of course, not the name dʒi·
of the letter). Then we can write them down in a third row.
<i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>m</i> were what kind of sounds?&mdash;Lip-sounds.&mdash;And <i>t</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>n</i>, were what kind? Point-of-the-tongue sounds.&mdash;And
the third row?&mdash;Back-of-the-tongue sounds.&mdash;Yes, we might
also say simply point-sounds and back-sounds. [Here
some one will ask]: Why are there not three there?&mdash;Yes,
there are three sounds there too, but we have no letter for
the third. Say <i>tinker</i>, and then <i>tin-kettle</i>. Is there no
difference? Yes, in <i>tin-kettle</i> we have a pure <i>n</i>, but not in
<i>tinker</i>; here we have another sound before <i>k</i>.&mdash;Now try
<i>finger</i>.&mdash;There we have the same before <i>g</i>.&mdash;And in <i>singer</i>?&mdash;The
same without a real <i>g</i>.&mdash;Look into my mouth when I
say (s)<i>inger</i> [without s]. We can make a letter for this
new sound by writing an <i>n</i>, with the last stroke lengthened
below the line and slightly curled, as in <i>g</i>: ŋ.&mdash;James,
come up here and write down the four words as they
sound, making use of the new letter.&mdash;(He writes first <i>tin-kettle</i>).&mdash;No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
do you hear more than one <i>t</i>? and can you
hear any <i>e</i> after <i>l</i>?&mdash;No.&mdash;What then? <i>tinketl</i>. (It is
not worth while at this stage to require greater phonetical
exactness than <i>tinketl</i>, <i>tiŋker</i>, <i>fiŋger</i>, <i>siŋer</i>, passing over the
fact that the final <i>er</i> in the words does not really sound like
e + r). You see, if you were a Frenchman trying to learn
English, you would not know that <i>n</i> in <i>tin-kettle</i> and in the
other words were different sounds, and that the <i>e</i> was
silent, and you would pronounce the words incorrectly;
but if the one were written <i>tinketl</i> and the other <i>tiŋker</i>, it
would be much easier for you to learn how to pronounce
them. And then take <i>fringe</i>; it looks as if it were simply
<i>finger</i> with the <i>r</i> in another place, and yet it is quite a
different sound, so we see that the two letters <i>ng</i> may stand
for three entirely different sounds. We also write <i>knight</i>,
and say “nait”; we write <i>busy</i> and say “bizi.” Can you
find any other words which we spell differently from the way
in which we pronounce them? [Various examples are
found and analyzed.] When we write the words exactly as
they sound, we call it <i>phonetical transcription</i>. Now, in the
beginning, we shall write all French words phonetically, so
that you can more easily learn how to pronounce them.
But you saw in the case of <i>tinker</i> that we occasionally need
a new symbol in this transcription, which we do not use
otherwise. You will learn a few more of them in the course
of time.... Then we have seen that in order to say
different sounds, we can use the lips and the point of the
tongue and the back of the tongue. Is there nothing else
that we need to speak with?&mdash;The nose? Yes, that is all
right in a way, but&mdash;can you move your nose? Look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
my nose; do I move it when I speak?&mdash;No.&mdash;But is it not
possible to use it without moving it? Now, see if I use
my nose when I say a···· [very long drawn out].<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Now,
I suddenly hold my nose with two fingers, and press the
nostrils together. Does that make the sound different?&mdash;No.&mdash;But
now I say m in the same way m···· and pinch
the nostrils together in the same way. Did anything
happen?&mdash;Yes, there was no sound.&mdash;Now you can try it
yourselves. First you, George; say a···, and then the
boy next to you can suddenly pinch your nose together
with two fingers. And then say m···, and let Fred pinch
your nose again. Can you say m while your nostrils are
closed?&mdash;No, at any rate the sound soon disappears. All
of you try it; say a· just as long as I do, and pinch the nose
together several times with your fingers whenever you see
me do it; and now likewise with m. That is because the
air has to escape through the nose in order that the sound
m may be made. It is the soft palate that you use in
order to open the inner entrance to the nose, so that the
air can escape through the nostrils. You can feel the
palate behind the teeth, there it is hard; but if you pass
your fingers farther back, you will soon feel that it becomes
soft and flexible. See how it can go up and down in my
mouth. Look in the mirror<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, and see how your own palate
is. First try breathing in and out silently, and then say <i>a</i>;
then you will see how your soft palate suddenly jumps up;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that is because it has to close the entrance to the nose, so
that no air can get out that way. But when you say m it
remains hanging down, so that the air can come out
through the nose, the passage through the mouth being
closed by the lips. [At this point, you might make a rough
sketch on the blackboard, showing a cross-section through
the mouth, with the soft palate in the two positions.] In
producing n and ŋ, you have the same position of the soft
palate as in the case of m. [Try to pinch the nose
together.]</p>

<p>Now we have seen how we use the nose and the mouth
when we speak, but are they the only things that are necessary
in speaking? [If the pupils cannot think of “voice”
of their own accord, the teacher may put them on the track
by saying: when someone speaks (or sings) very well, we
say that he has a good...]&mdash;Voice.&mdash;Where is the voice?&mdash;In
the vocal chords.&mdash;And where are they?&mdash;In Adam’s
apple.&mdash;[Here it might be a good thing not to despise the
anecdote about the apple which stuck in Adam’s throat.]
Now we also call that the larynx. In there, there are two
vocal chords stretched parallel to each other, and when
they vibrate a tone is produced, and that is what we call
voice. It is just as when a string of a violin is brought into
vibration and gives forth a tone; or a bell or a wine-glass,
which is made to quiver violently. Now do we always use
the voice when we speak? You do not know; well, then
we can experiment. [Whisper a sentence.] Did I use my
voice then?&mdash;No.&mdash;Now try first to say an a··· quite loudly
and forcibly (or sing it), and take firm hold of Adam’s
apple with your thumb and forefinger; then you will feel it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
quiver. Have you never tried to touch a piano with your
finger tips while someone was playing on it? Then you
will have felt the same kind of delicate, rapid, quivering
movements as you feel on touching the larynx while the
voice is in activity. In both cases you can <em>feel</em> those movements
with your fingers which you <em>hear</em> with your ear as a
tone. But now whisper an a··· and feel your larynx; do
you feel anything?&mdash;No, there are no vibrations.&mdash;And try
to say s··· [by no means the name of the letter, <i>es</i>, but the
hissing sound itself.] Is there voice in that? Do you feel
any vibration?&mdash;No.&mdash;Then s is a <em>voiceless</em> sound, but a is a
<em>voiced</em> sound. Now, try m··· [not <i>em</i>!] Is it voiced?
and n···? Notice that you can sing the voiced sounds
[test several of them], but not the voiceless sounds.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> That
f··· is voiceless, and that v··· (with strong buzzing!) is
voiced, is easily discovered. In the same way, we have for
every voiceless sound a corresponding voiced sound. Say
s···, and now produce the corresponding voiced sound
with the buzzing element. They are the sounds we have in
<i>so</i> and <i>zoo</i>, <i>seal</i> and <i>zebra</i>. We have also a third corresponding
pair ʃ and ʒ; ʃ is the sound in <i>shilling</i>, <i>shall</i>, etc.;
ʒ is the sound in <i>measure</i>, <i>pleasure</i>, etc. Then we may
write down:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>f</td><td>s</td><td>ʃ</td><td>voiceless</td></tr>
<tr><td>v</td><td>z</td><td>ʒ</td><td>voiced.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now pronounce each sound in chorus as I point to the
letter, and continue drawing it out until I take the chalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
away from the letter.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Thereupon the pupils may be
tested singly, the teacher skipping from one sound to the
other. Exercises may also be given with the consonants
between two vowels: afffa, avvva, asssa, azzza; afa, ava,
asa, aza.</p>

<p>Now the pupils have already had a little course in
elementary phonetics; it interests them and contains nothing
that they cannot understand, and nothing that is not useful
for them. Nor does it ever really frighten the children;
but the very thought of it has actually frightened a number
of older teachers, who apparently live in holy terror of trespassing
beyond the lines laid out for them in their childhood,
and who unfailingly think that everything new must
be just as useless, dry and pedantical as most of what they
learned in their own schooldays, so they are not inclined
to have the bother of making themselves familiar with anything
new.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the Danish original of this book, I reprinted
as a curiosity a description of the activity of the
organs of speech in the production of speech-sounds, which
a boy 14 years old, who had never been told anything
about the formation of sounds, had written all by himself,
without the least instruction or help of any kind (which can
easily be seen, among other things, from the fact that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sticks to and analyzes the names of the letters); it shows
that this dreaded phonetical science is not so terribly far
beyond the horizon of ordinary children after all.</p>

<p>The children always “follow” the teacher so well in these
phonetical exercises that it is rather necessary to put a
damper on their eagerness to try to produce the sounds
than to spur them on. Or, in other words, the teacher
has but to organize their natural impulse to imitate the
sounds by saying to them, when they begin to whistle and
hum: “You may say the sounds yourselves directly, just
wait a moment,” and thereupon, after the explanation has been
given, by allowing them ample opportunity to pronounce
the sounds, both in chorus and singly. Then, both during
recess and at home, they will revel to their hearts’ content
in the new sounds, and the whole new and amusing world
that has been opened to them.</p>

<p>After the introductory course which I have just sketched,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
I immediately begin with texts in the foreign language. If
the teacher will at this point read one or two pages aloud
rapidly (or give a little talk) in as characteristically a
French or German manner as possible, this is a very good
way to give the pupils a preliminary notion of the foreignness
of the new language. This impression may be further
emphasized by means of a little trick which I may recommend.
The teacher practises an English sentence pronounced
as a Frenchman (or German respectively) would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
pronounce it, with French vowels, French accent, etc. He
may refer to this sentence now and then in speaking of the
single sounds, and it will serve to warn the students
against the kind of mistakes that they themselves are to
avoid. Then I take up the new sounds in the more
accidental order in which they occur in the selection for
reading; I repeat every word, together with its meaning,
write it down on the blackboard in phonetical transcription,
and explain every symbol as it occurs, at the same time
articulating the corresponding sound <em>isolated</em> (this is of
great importance! also the consonants alone without any
vowel, either before or after), and drawing it out very
long.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In not a few cases, the pupils will be able to imitate the
sound with sufficient exactness, when it has been produced
isolated; at all events, they do it far better than when they
only hear it among other sounds. But in many other cases
their imitation is not successful, or, at least, it is not sure
enough to be quite satisfactory; then it is necessary to
resort to phonetics for help, on the basis of the introductory
course.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not easy for a Dane to give detailed directions
for phonetical instruction, as it is to be conducted
when an English teacher is teaching English children
French or German. Therefore, the following section is
necessarily shorter than the corresponding section in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Danish original, where I could treat the subject exhaustively
on the basis of my personal experience, as to how good
results are to be obtained. But some few remarks may
perhaps serve to point out the right way, and any teacher
who has thoroughly mastered the first principles of
phonetics theoretically, and especially practically, will himself
be able to supplement my suggestions.</p>

<p>In the very first French or German sentence in the
reader will probably be found one of the sounds [y] (Fr.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur</i>, Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">über</i>), or [ø] (Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">veut</i>, Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">höhe</i>). It is best for
these two sounds to be practised together, and, in the
beginning, in their long form. As experience shows, it is
not sufficient for the teacher merely to say these sounds;
they generally cause English people much trouble, and all
imitations based on the diphthong in Eng. <i>few</i>, etc., ought
to be strictly discountenanced from the very first lesson.
That it is not impossible to learn the correct sounds was
brought home to me in a striking manner a few years ago.
These sounds are also found in Danish; an English lady
who had been in Denmark for some years had not been
able, in spite of unceasing efforts, to learn them by imitation.
Then I made a bet that I could teach her them in
less than ten minutes, and I won the bet through five
minutes’ theoretical explanation of rounded and unrounded
vowels, and two minutes’ practical exercises. The directions
were about as follows: say [u·] (or [uw]) in <i>too</i> very
loudly, and hold it as long as you can without taking
breath. Once more: observe in the hand-mirror the position
of the lips. Then say <i>tea</i> [ti·, tij] in the same way;
draw the vowel out until you can hold it no longer; con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>tinue
all the time to observe the position of the lips in the
mirror. Now [u···] again; then [i···]. The lips are
rounded for some vowels, slit-shaped for others. Try to
pout them rather more than you do usually. Pronounce
[u···] a couple of times with the lips as rounded and close
to each other as possible, and concentrate your attention
on the lips. Then say [i···] a couple of times, paying
attention to the position of the tongue; you will feel that
the sides of the tongue touch the roof of the mouth or the
teeth. Now look in the mirror; say [i···] again, and now
suddenly, taking care to keep the tongue in the same position,
let your lips take the rounded, pouted position they
had before. It may be that the pupil is still unable to produce
any [y], because, despite the teacher’s warning, he
involuntarily shifts his tongue-position back again to the
familiar [u] position. In that case, however, the teacher
must not be discouraged, but pass on to the second part of
the experiment, which is surer, and which might therefore
have been taken first: place your lips in this pouted [u]
position, without producing any sound, look in the mirror,
and be very careful that the position of the lips remains
unchanged, and then try to say [i···]. If the tongue is
placed in the correct [i···]-position, the result cannot be
anything but an [y]. This sound is retained and repeated
until the pupil is perfectly sure of both the articulation and
acoustic effect. Then the sound [ø] may be taken up. It
may be produced with [y] as a starting-point, the lower jaw
being lowered so that both the underlip and the tongue
follow it, while the teacher takes care to stop the downward
movement in the right place. The result may be controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by starting with [e] and rounding the lips, that is, by going
through a process corresponding to the transition from [i···]
to [y···].</p>

<p>One of the most unbecoming mistakes which Englishmen
make in their pronunciation of foreign languages is
their diphthongizing of long vowels, since long vowels,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in
ordinary English, are pronounced with an upward glide, so
that the jaw and the tongue are raised higher in the last
part of the vowels in <i>see</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>hay</i>, <i>know</i>, for instance,
than in the first part. In vulgar London pronunciation,
this English peculiarity is carried further, the beginning of
the sound being lowered, at all events in the last two sounds
mentioned, so that <i>lace</i> sounds like <i>lice</i>, and <i>pay</i> like <i>pie</i>.
But even if the best pronunciation does not go to this
extreme, yet the glide is there, and this glide is for the
native Frenchman or German one of the most striking
faults in the Englishman’s pronunciation of the respective
languages, so the Englishman had best be on his guard in
this particular. If the teacher, after a little theoretical
explanation, says the English [ei] and the German [e]
alternately a number of times, even the dullest pupils cannot
help but get their ears trained to detect this difference,
but long and patient training is certainly necessary, both
with the class in chorus and with the pupils singly, before
this deeply rooted tendency to diphthongize can be
checked.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is met with in the short (narrow)
vowels. French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">été</i> must be pronounced with two short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
closed e’s; Englishmen have a tendency to pronounce two
long or half-long glide-sounds, which begin with a greater
distance between the jaws than they ought to, and close
with a smaller distance between the jaws than the genuine
French sounds have. Anyone who has become accustomed
to the undiphthongized long [e], however, can use
this as a starting-point for learning the correct short sound,
the best way being the frequent repetition of <i>tétété···</i> Likewise
the short sounds in <i>fini</i>, <i>dodo</i>, <i>froufrou</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Nor do the French nasal vowels occur in English; in
phonetical transcription, they are indicated by means of
~ over the vowel-symbol, for instance [ɔ̃] in <i>son</i>, etc. Here
the teacher must immediately make every effort to check
the tendency to say [ɔŋ] as in Eng. <i>long</i>, and my
experience with Danish pupils has been that it is not sufficient
for this purpose merely to let the pupils repeat the
sound after me. It is necessary to make it perfectly clear
to them wherein the difference consists. First the teacher
draws out his [ɔ̃] and establishes (by means of questions)
that it is only one sound, the same from first to last. Then
one of the pupils is to try to draw out the sound [ɔŋ], and
it thus becomes clear that it is only the last of the two
sounds that is prolonged. On the basis of what has
been previously learned (p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>), the teacher shows the
difference of effect caused in closing the nostrils with the
fingers, and explains that it is due to the fact that in [ɔŋ]
we have first a sound where the air escapes only through
the mouth, then another sound where the air only passes
out through the nose; but in [ɔ̃], both passages are open
at the same time. If a pencil is laid in the mouth so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
it rests on the tongue (tolerably far back), it will remain
lying quietly when [ɔ̃] is pronounced, but not in the case
of [ɔŋ]. In connection with [ɔ̃], the pupils may practise
the [ɑ̃] sound in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant</i>, [ɛ̃] or, more correctly, [æ̃], the sound
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">teint</i> and the rounded sound in [œ̃], <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un</i>. The sound [ɥ]
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuer</i> [tɥe], <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lui</i> [lɥi] is easily learned with sufficient exactness
as a [y] which is quickly passed over so that the main
stress is allowed to fall on the following sound, the relation
between [w] and [u] being brought in by way of comparison.</p>

<p>With respect to the consonants, care must be taken to
pronounce [t, d, n] in such a way that the point of the
tongue touches the upper teeth; it must, at all events, not
be held as far back as in English; the same applies to [l],
where this difference is still more important; the hollow
sound of the English <i>l</i> is also to be avoided by keeping the
whole tongue more flat and not hollowing it out like a
spoon. The voiceless sounds [r̥] and [l̥] in [fənɛ·tr̥]
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fenêtre</i> and [tabl̥] <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table</i> can easily be deduced from what has
been learned about the voice (p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_151">151</a>); it is necessary
to guard against making [r̥] into the vowel found at the end
of English words like <i>mister</i>, etc. The pupils will easily
understand that with the correct unvoiced pronunciation,
these sounds are apt to disappear in rapid speech. Finally
we take up the sound ɲ in [kãpaɲ] <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">campagne</i>; it is
explained as lying between [nj] and [ŋ]; it is best
pronounced with the point of the tongue resting in the
lower part of the mouth behind the lower teeth, but in using
the word “best” I intend to hint that it is not strictly
necessary to require this method of formation; there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
also Frenchmen who (at all events before a vowel) pronounce
it like English [nj] in <i>onion</i>.</p>

<p>With respect to [p, t, k], it is well known that in French
they have not the aspiration that they have in English;
since the difference is not so great, however, the English
sounds may perhaps be used unchanged in the beginning.
Then if one of the pupils notices the difference, which he
perhaps will express by saying that the teacher pronounces [b]
when there stands [p] in the book, or possibly by merely trying
to imitate the teacher’s sound by means of his own English
[b], his attention may be called to the little breath which
there always is between the opening of the English [p] and
the vowel itself; this is not found in French, where the
vowel after [p, t, k] comes exactly at the same moment as
the opening takes place (either by the lips or the tongue),
and therefore they sound to us like [b, d, g] (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine</i> as if
it were gabidɛn). Try a [p] without a vowel after it, first
with a strong breath (somewhat like when you pooh-pooh
something, but without any voice), then without any breath
like a man puffing at his pipe (about the same sound as
when soap bubbles burst); and then try to place a vowel
after it<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>; it must come immediately, just as quickly as the
movements of a soldier after the drill-master’s command.
Then [t] and [k] may be taken up in the same manner.</p>

<p>The French division into syllables (<i>il a</i> =i | la, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaque
écolier</i> = ʃa | ke | kɔ | lje, | etc.) is best learned by pure imitation,
likewise the distribution of stress (accent); by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
reciting or reading connectedly to the pupils and by always
requiring them to say <em>the whole sentence together without any
pause</em>, the teacher can counteract their tendency to pronounce
each word separately in that monotone which is
intolerable. Thus <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il a été ici</i> is said all together in one with
the vowels gliding over into each other, <i>a + é</i> sounding
somewhat similar to [ai] in <i>lie</i>, and <i>é + i</i> to [ei] in <i>lay</i>.</p>

<p>German sounds are somewhat easier for Englishmen
than French sounds, but yet there are several points to be
noticed. In the case of some sounds, any skilled teacher
will be able to follow the suggestions given for French,
mutatis mutandis; in the case of others, like the two <i>ch-</i>
sounds, he must in an analogous manner adapt his
theoretical knowledge in phonetics to the practical needs
of teaching.</p>

<p>Some people have found it inconsistent that I have no
partiality for didactic theorizing in questions of grammar,
but myself employ theoretical explanations in questions of
phonetics. The explanation is not far to seek. Theoretical
grammar, as it is generally studied, is more abstract, it is
difficult, it is very comprehensive, and still it does not lead
to the desired goal, which is grammatical correctness; the
theory of sound which we want introduced is more concrete
and it is easy, it is more limited, and it actually leads to
the desired goal, which is a good pronunciation. This last
assertion is proved by the experiences of numerous teachers
in various lands.</p>

<p>Of late years, it has become more and more usual in
schools to use a sound-chart in connection with the
instruction in languages. On this chart, all the sounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the language which is being studied are arranged in
systematic order, and are indicated with such large letters
that they can be seen by the whole class; various finesses
are often used, as for instance to give the voiced and voiceless
sounds different colours.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> I myself have not used this
contrivance, but I have heard from several foreign teachers,
and now from a couple of Danish teachers too, that they
are very well satisfied with it. The teacher points to a
letter and gets either the whole class or one of the pupils to
say the corresponding sound; or the teacher may let A
mention some sound or other, and B, who is standing at
the blackboard, shows that he has caught it by repeating it
and at the same time pointing at the symbol; or if C
makes a mistake in the pronunciation of a word which he
is reading (or saying) D is to point, first to the symbol for
the wrong sound, and then to the right one, etc. In this
way, much writing on the blackboard, which would otherwise
be necessary, is saved; and besides, it may be of great
benefit for the pupils always to have all the sounds in a
connected system before their eyes (even if the teacher of
course never intends to examine them in the whole phonetical
system of the language as such).</p>

<p>The <em>elements of phonetical transcription</em> are learned,
as we have seen, together with the corresponding sounds
themselves. Now what is the use of the phonetical
transcription itself? It seems to be commonly supposed
that its votaries claim by its help to have
“given the pupils a better comprehension of the single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sounds and to have taught them more easily to produce
them;” its opponents attack this assertion and strike
it down with true Quixotic zeal without stopping to
think that it has never been set up by the advocates
of phonetical transcription at all. These advocates
themselves know as well as anyone what is but natural,
namely, that a boy does not of his own accord pronounce a
French nasal correctly merely because he has been shown
the symbol [ɔ̃]. The pronunciation of the single sounds
must be learned in other ways, as has been shown above,
and for that purpose alone, all writing could very well be
entirely dispensed with without resulting in any essential
change in the character of the instruction. When, however,
we use phonetical transcription already at the first stage,
it is partly on account of the excellent help which it
will afford later for quite a different purpose, which I shall
come to immediately, partly because it really is of some <em>help</em>
in the teaching of the sound-formation proper. It saves
the teacher a great deal of repetition, since instead of
always saying the sound himself, he can point to the symbol
and get one of the clever pupils to say it for the others;
it makes the pupils see more clearly how many different
sounds there are for them to pay attention to (while in
exclusively oral instruction, perhaps one pupil will be
inclined to hear [ɑ̃] and [ɛ̃] as one sound, another pupil, [ɑ̃]
and [ɔ̃] as one sound); finally, the homogeneousness of
the symbols will help the pupils more easily to comprehend
the nature of the sounds themselves; when they have
learned to pronounce [ɔ̃], they will get the run of all the
other nasal vowels more quickly when they see the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
flourish over them all; the double parallelism in the four
symbols</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>s</td><td>ʃ</td></tr>
<tr><td>z</td><td>ʒ</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>will aid them in learning the corresponding relations
between the sounds themselves.</p>

<p>However, in order to understand the greatest and the
proper value of phonetical transcription, it is necessary to
have well in mind the fact that there are two essentially
different kinds of mistakes in <span class="lock">pronunciation&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. Mistakes in the formation of the sounds, and</p>

<p>B. Mistakes in the employment of the sounds.</p>

<p>We have mistakes belonging to Class A, for instance,
when Englishmen use the <i>ng</i> combination in place of the
French nasals, or when they diphthongize the French long,
pure vowels, when they pronounce <i>ʃ</i> or <i>k</i> instead of
German <i>ch</i>, or [z] or [s] for German <i>z</i> [ts], [ə·], as in <i>cur</i>,
instead of [œ·r] in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cœur</i>, when they pronounce
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dû</i> like the English <i>due</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Mistakes belonging to Class B arise if you pronounce
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gent</i> like <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gant</cite>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut</i> like <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">put</cite>, or vice versâ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eut</i> like
[ø], German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">frass</i> or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fuss</i> with a short, or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nass</i> or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nuss</i> with
a long vowel, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bischen</i> with [ʃ], etc.</p>

<p>Both kinds of mistakes may occur in the same word, as
when <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">München</i> is pronounced [minkən] or [mjuŋkən]
instead of [mynçen].</p>

<p>The mistakes belonging to class A are not due to the
orthography; those mistakes we can also make in languages
whose spelling corresponds to the pronunciation; they are
largely due to our native habits of articulation, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are to be counteracted by means of the phonetical training
which has been described above. If the foreign
sounds have once been well learned in the introductory
course, this kind of mistakes can only occur
through carelessness or through the lack of continued
practice.</p>

<p>Mistakes in the employment of the sounds (class B)
however, are as a rule due to disagreement between the
pronunciation and the orthography of each language; they
are not caused by our native habits of articulation, and
even those that have learned all the foreign sounds perfectly
(indeed even the natives themselves) are liable to make
them in every new word which they see written, but have
never heard.</p>

<p><em>It is this last kind of mistake that phonetical transcription
helps us to avoid</em>, it protects us against the mistakes
which the different national orthographies actually seduce
us to make. Phonetical transcription is necessary in the
teaching of all languages, but of course, it may deviate
from the ordinary orthography in greater or less degree in
the different languages. In Finnish and Spanish, the
orthography is so nearly phonetical that only relatively few
changes are necessary in order to indicate the pronunciation;
in Italian, almost all that is needed is to indicate if <i>e</i>
and <i>o</i> are open or closed, if <i>s</i> and <i>z</i> are voiced [z, dz] or voiceless
[s, ts], and which single consonants are to be pronounced
double (long). In German, the orthography is already
much more capricious, but in languages like French,
Danish, and English, the number of conflicting rules with
all their exceptions is so great that the phonetical trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>cription
necessarily has quite a different appearance from
the traditional spelling.</p>

<p>Max Müller once said that the English orthography is a
national misfortune, and Viëtor has improved upon this
observation by declaring that it is an international misfortune,
since it is not only Englishmen but also all
educated persons in other lands who have to be bothered
with it. Now, by means of phonetical transcription
the words of the foreign language are presented to us
in a kind of normal or ideal orthography, where every
letter always signifies the same sound, and every sound is
always indicated in the same manner.</p>

<p>Some persons urge the objection against the use of
phonetical transcription that it can never be made so perfect
that it can show all the shades of intonation, etc., in
the spoken language, so that it cannot take the place of a
teacher’s oral instruction. But we have never maintained
that it could; aside from private study without a teacher,
which must needs always be more or less imperfect, we
have always emphasized the exceedingly great importance
of the teacher pronouncing the words for the pupils, and
we have not recommended phonetical transcription as
something to replace, but as something to support, the
teacher’s oral instruction in pronunciation. Even if
it misses some of the very finest shades, it may still be of
benefit, just as a table of logarithms can be very useful
even if the numbers are not carried out farther than to the
fourth decimal place.</p>

<p>Other opponents again have exactly the reverse objection
to make, that our system of sound-symbols is too delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
detailed for school use. Even if many people only say
this because they confuse the phonetical transcription which
is used in scientific works with the far simpler transcription
which we want to introduce for school use, and which is
by no means beyond the powers of comprehension of an
ordinary pupil, still we have an answer right at hand. We
are aiming at (and attaining) greater exactness than our
predecessors cared for, but this is very necessary too, for
the old school pronunciation was too unintelligible to the
native. Besides, our system is constructed on such simple
principles, that we attain to a higher degree of exactness
with less trouble than you do with far more difficult
means. When mathematicians began to designate the
value of π in decimal form (3·1416) instead of the fractional
form 22/7, they not only attained greater exactness
but also greater ease in using the quantity in long calculations,
since the decimal is easier to handle than the fraction.
Our phonetical transcription may pride itself on exactly
corresponding advantages.</p>

<p>It has already been tried in many old readers (to say
nothing of the dictionaries) to counteract the injurious
influence of the orthography on the pronunciation by means
of different systems of designating the pronunciation, such
as numbers over the vowels, strokes denoting length and
curves denoting shortness, italicizing of the <i>s</i>’s which ought
to be voiced, or in other places italicizing of the silent
letters, dots and flourishes above and under the letters. All
such systems, just because they try to deviate as little as
possible from the orthography, necessarily adopt a number
of its caprices and thus become too complicated to be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
any real benefit to the pupils. But the phoneticians, by
starting out from rational principles, have succeeded in
creating systems of phonetical transcription which really
meet all reasonable demands in the way of exactness and
simplicity.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> That they really are simple and easy to learn
has been proved to me more than once in striking ways;
in several schools where my books are used but where the
teacher has been afraid of the phonetical transcription, the
children have resorted to it of their own accord, when they
came to a word that they did not know how to pronounce;
several parents have also told me that they have familiarized
themselves with the phonetical transcription in the books
which their children used and they did not find it at all
difficult.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is worth while here to consider the four ways
in which it is possible to communicate the material of
a foreign language to pupils. Either (1) the teacher may
not let them use any writing at all, but give them everything
orally; or (2) he may give them the orthography alone; or
(3) he may give them orthography and phonetical transcription
together; or finally (4) he may give them phonetical
transcription alone.</p>

<p>(1) The first way obviously has the advantage that there
is no sound-symbol whatever to confuse the clear apprehension
of the pupils; it resembles the manner in which a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
learns its mother tongue. It will also be the more in place
the more the instruction can be brought to resemble the
way in which a child first acquires language, that is, where
there is only one pupil, or at least very few; where the
pupil (pupils) is (are) not very old, and especially not yet
quite familiar with the secrets of writing; where the teacher
is a native; and above all, where there is ample time. For
we must not shut our eyes to the fact that this exclusively
oral instruction in languages takes exceedingly much time;
much repetition is necessary, and the teacher has to have
great patience. In schools it is only possible to have
purely oral instruction as a short preliminary course of a
couple of months at the most, before passing over to the
use of writing in some form or other. Walter, who has
tried both, is emphatically of the opinion that in class
instruction phonetical transcription is much to be preferred
to purely oral instruction, because the latter wastes an
enormous amount of time, and the teacher cannot feel
nearly so sure that the whole class is able to follow.</p>

<p>(2) The pupils are immediately allowed to see the traditional
orthography, and the teacher gives them the pronunciation
orally. The eternal repetition and the painful
small corrections which this method craves make the
lessons bothersome for both the teacher and the pupils,
who almost always become slovenly out of sheer discouragement
over the prodigious task before them. Of course
there are some rules for the relations between orthography
and pronunciation, but unfortunately there are so few
without exceptions that certainty cannot be attained by
their means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The pupils are taught the traditional spelling from
the very beginning, but at the same time they are given an
antidote in the shape of phonetical transcription, either in
the form that every new word is phonetically transcribed in
the glossary, or that (in addition) the reading selections
themselves are transcribed. To be sure the advantages of
phonetical transcription are made use of by this method;
several teachers have expressed their satisfaction at the
results thus obtained, and I have no doubt that they are
better than when phonetical transcription is dispensed with.
However, I am convinced that by this method it is
difficult sometimes to prevent the less intelligent pupils from
confusing the two systems of spelling, so that they neither
learn the pronunciation nor the orthography very well.</p>

<p>(4) Therefore I have always (like the majority of the
advocates of phonetical transcription) preferred to let
beginners be employed only with phonetical transcription
for some time, so that they may become quite familiar
not only with the system of sound-symbols, but also with a
good deal of the material of the language before they pass
on to seeing the words in their orthographical shape too.
The principle to be followed here is that of not allowing
the difficulties to pile up, but overcoming them one by one.
When the pupils know the symbols after the first few
lessons, it causes them no difficulty whatever to read the
texts; these themselves (together with the meaning of the
words, the grammatical forms, etc.) are therefore far more
easy to learn than if the caprices of the orthography had to
be mastered <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<p>For this method, connected texts in phonetical transcription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
are of course necessary, but such texts are also to be recommended
to those who follow method No. 3, since there are
many points of pronunciation which cannot come up at
all in the transcriptions of the single words in the glossary,
such points as appear only in combinations of words, in
connected discourse. There is, for instance, French [ə] in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demande</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devenir</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre</i>, etc., etc., which is sometimes
pronounced and sometimes omitted, according to the number
of consonants coming immediately before or after the
[ə]: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à devenir</i> [advəni·r], <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour devenir</i> [purdəvni·r], etc.;
there is the varying treatment of the English <i>r</i>; there are
double forms due to the influence of sentence-stress, such
as [kæn] and [kən] (= <i>can</i>), and many other phenomena
of that kind, which it is really necessary to pay attention to,
since no sentence can be pronounced naturally without
consideration for these points, and since we cannot
understand the natives without being familiar with them<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;for
we cannot require the French to make their language
stiff and do violence to all their natural habits of speech to
suit us. Only by using connected texts in phonetical
transcription can the teacher require the pupils from the
very beginning to read the foreign language connectedly,
intelligently, and with some expression.</p>

<p>In conversations on the subject, I have so often had to
answer the question as to whether I also want the pupils to
learn to <em>write</em> phonetical transcription, that I must devote a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
few lines to that question here too. Of course they must
write phonetical transcription, but <em>learn</em> it&mdash;well, that is
scarcely necessary, for it will not entail the least bit of extra
work or trouble for them. They learn the symbols, and
when they know them they can write any word whatever
in phonetical transcription, if they only know how to
pronounce it; this is a thing which follows of its own
accord from the very nature of phonetical transcription.
Dictation, in which the pupils are to write in phonetical
transcription what the teacher says to them, presupposes
only a correct apprehension of the sounds, and is a very
good test as to whether they have heard accurately (cf.
p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>).</p>

<p>How long is a teacher to continue to use exclusively
phonetical transcription? That is one of the most difficult
questions, and I cannot venture to give a decided answer.
The answer will surely always depend partly upon the age
and maturity of the pupils and upon how much time can
be spent upon the language on the whole. I myself have
even dared to go so far that in teaching a class in English,
when I only had two hours a week for two years before the
final examination, I spent the whole of the first year on
phonetical transcription (Sweet’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elementarbuch</cite>), and I did
not regret it. In French in the lower classes, I once at
least used phonetical transcription more than a year, and the
only difficulty arose when some boys came in in the
course of the year from other schools. At other times,
again, I have made the course in phonetical transcription
shorter, and on the whole I have experimented in various
ways without coming to any certain result&mdash;except this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<em>continue with phonetical transcription as long as possible</em>.
For there is relatively so much more of the language itself
learned in this way, that I have not the slightest doubt
that the pupil who, with the same number of lessons a
week, and at the same age, has read phonetical transcription
for two years and orthography for half a year knows
more of the language (not only of the pronunciation!) than
the pupil who has used phonetical transcription for half a
year and thereupon orthography for two and a half years
(in all half a year more than the first boy). And then the
phonetical transcription itself is such a fine means of
training the pupils to minute exactness, because they really
have to be constantly on the lookout in order to read
neither more nor less than each symbol indicates; therefore
I attach great <em>educational</em> significance to phonetical
transcription.</p>

<p>But of course we have to begin to learn the orthography
some time; and I suppose it is this transition more than
anything else that has frightened people away from using
phonetical transcription, because they imagine that it must
be extremely difficult. But now all those who have dared
to try phonetical transcription unanimously declare that
they were surprised at the ease with which the transition
took place; there was no trouble worth mentioning either
for the teacher or the pupils; and they were surprised at
the accuracy in orthography displayed by pupils who had
been taught in this way. The psychological reason for
this is probably to be found in the sharper perception
which these pupils necessarily get of the difference between
sound and writing, together with the fact that they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
compelled like the others to learn many things at a time
(spelling, pronunciation, meaning, inflection), but the orthography
is separated out as something which is to be learned
by itself about words with whose pronunciation and meaning
they have already become quite familiar.</p>

<p>The best way of making the transition seems to be in
going over some of the selections which have already been
read and learned. First, the teacher says a few words
about orthography in general, basing his remarks on English
spelling; he may call attention to the silent letters in
<i>night</i>, <i>know</i>, the ambiguity of the vowels in <i>home</i>, <i>honest</i>,
etc. Then a French piece the pupils know already is
shown to them in orthographical dress; it is gone through
word by word in such a way that the pupils themselves
may be guided to find out the most important relations
between the letters and their sound-values. Here they for
the first time have something to do with the accents and
the cedilla, whose name they learn.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In the following lessons the comparison between spelling
and sound is conducted in the same manner as indicated
above for grammatical observations; sometimes starting
from a certain sound, the students may point out all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
words in which it occurs on a page or so; sometimes
starting from the orthography, they may note and classify
all the phonetical values of a certain letter. A few lessons
will be sufficient for these preliminaries.</p>

<p>Ought the teacher to require the pupils to learn the
orthography from the very beginning, that is, ought he to
examine them in spelling or let them write dictation?
No&mdash;that is not generally the practice according to the
non-phonetical method either. First let them become
accustomed to seeing the spelling, and in the exercises
just suggested let them copy out of the book; later on
they may be required to learn how to spell the words in
the first line of every lesson, and in the course of a few
months the pupils will be just as much at home in their
French and German orthography as any pedant could
require&mdash;and much more at home than they generally are
now after a long time.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Phonetical transcription ought by no means to be given
up on beginning with the orthography: it is too good an aid
to be dispensed with at this point. Not only ought whole
pieces to be read, occasionally at least, in phonetical transcription,
but it ought to be used in connection with all new words
(thus especially in the glossary) in order to prevent all guesswork.
Thereby is also obtained another important result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
at a later stage, namely, the teacher may be <em>just as strict in
requiring the pronunciation to be learned as the meaning</em>,
whereas without phonetical transcription he cannot expect
the pronunciation to be prepared at home. By steadily
keeping up their practice in transposing phonetical transcription
into practical pronunciation the pupils have something
of value for their whole life, for, when they no longer
have a teacher to ask about the pronunciation of a new
word, they can obtain information about it themselves.
That which was only a few years ago a possibility reserved
for the distant future, namely, that all French and English
dictionaries should give the pronunciation according to
rational principles, is now, as we know, well under way to
become a reality at any time.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The use of phonetics and phonetical transcription in the
teaching of modern languages must be considered as one
of the most important advances in modern pedagogy,
because it ensures both considerable facilitation and an
exceedingly large gain in exactness. But these means must
be employed immediately from the very beginning; just as
easy as it is to get a good pronunciation in this way, just as
difficult is it to root out the bad habits which may become inveterate
during a very short period of instruction according
to a wrong or antiquated method. Timotheus, an old well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>known
music-teacher, used to demand double payment of
all those pupils who had taken instruction with other
teachers before they came to him; the reason that he gave
was that he had much more trouble in teaching these
pupils than those who had not already acquired bad habits
for him to break them of. Go ye and do likewise, ye
teachers of languages!</p>

<p>I shall add a few words on the use of the phonograph.
The apparatus has been very much perfected of late years
and renders beautifully most vowels and all the general
features of stress, intonation, etc. But the rendering of
most consonants is still far from perfect; you cannot
always tell whether you hear a <i>p</i> or an <i>f</i>, etc., and it is
impossible to rely on a phonographic record for minute
shades of <i>s</i>-sounds and the like. It is clear, too, that even
if the apparatus were nearer the ideal than it is now, it
could not replace the teacher. But in the hands of an able
teacher I have no doubt that it will prove a valuable help:
it is patient and will repeat the same sentences scores of
times, if required, without tiring or changing a single sound
or intonation; you may also have different records of the
same short piece as pronounced by one man from
Berlin, another man from Hanover, a third from Munich,
and a fourth from Vienna, which may be very useful for
comparisons, even if, as a matter of course, in your
ordinary teaching you stick to one particular standard of
pronunciation&mdash;and in various other ways phonographic
records may be used to stimulate the pupils. But everything
they hear in this way should at the same time be presented
to them in phonetic writing&mdash;either in their readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
or on the blackboard. Perhaps, at some future day, the
“telegraphone” invented by my countryman V. Poulsen
will supplant Edison’s phonograph in this as well as
in other respects.</p>

<p>Like most works on pedagogy, this one too has been
mostly concerned with the teaching of beginners. But
now and then there has been a word about the instruction
of advanced pupils, and now I shall add a few more
suggestions about it. It is best to continue on the same
lines as during the first years, only making those changes
which circumstances necessarily demand.</p>

<p>The pupils must <em>read</em>&mdash;read more and more, read better
and better books, books whose contents are of a nature to
hold their attention and to give them as much all round
information and development as possible&mdash;accordingly, as
has been previously suggested, not solely works of literature.
That sort of reading is especially good which gives the
pupils some insight into the foreign nation’s peculiarity in
the widest sense of the word, and best of all is that reading
which is apt to make the pupils love what is best in the
foreign people. Tennyson is right when he says, “It is the
authors, more than the diplomats, who make nations love
one another”;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and teachers of modern languages should
ever remember that it is their mission to make their
countrymen know and understand foreign nations. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
making their pupils read good literature as well as by
capacitating the younger generations of different countries
for intelligent intercourse with one another, language-teachers
all over the world may ultimately prove more
efficacious in establishing good permanent relations
between the nations than Peace Congresses at the Hague.</p>

<p>Some reading must be taken thoroughly, some may be
<em>cursory</em>; it is perhaps best to have several gradations.
Whereas in the beginning it is necessary to chew well in
order to get all the linguistic nourishment out of the
reading, later on it may of course be taken in larger and
larger bites. Already rather early in the course of instruction,
those pieces may be more lightly passed over whose
contents are scarcely fit to be taken too seriously or which
contain words which it is not absolutely necessary to
remember. The teacher may simply let the pupils read
such pieces aloud, explaining every word which they do not
understand, but without basing any questions on them, and
without requiring them to be studied for the next time. Later
on, in the midst of more serious work, a month or two may
be taken for reading a light novel through in the same easy
manner. The pupils may also have private reading to do
at home in addition to what they read in school. The
teacher that I had in French and English in the upper
classes in Frederiksborg School (H. Mathiesen) had an
excellent way of making us desire of our own accord to
read novels in the language studied; each one of us was
ambitious to give in the longest list of volumes read when
the teacher called for the lists at the first lesson in every
month, and even if we of course read very rapidly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
never looked up any words, yet we learned a good deal,
and I consider the habit of reading which I thus acquired
to be one of the most valuable acquisitions that I got
during my last years in school. In order to test whether
we really had read the books as stated, our teacher sometimes
talked to us about their contents, but he talked in
Danish, sometimes he only made us open the books at random
and translate a little piece. It is no doubt better to
organize this practice, as it is now done in some parts of
Germany, where the whole class reads the same book at
home and must have read a certain amount by a certain
day (after a fortnight’s or a month’s interval). Then they
must be able to give an account of the contents in the foreign
language, must also ask each other questions about the
book, and may even occasionally be required to write down
the contents as a written exercise; after the teacher has
looked through these accounts, the pupils may deliver
them orally and more freely, and this will give occasion for
further conversation&mdash;all in the foreign language.</p>

<p>Most important, however, is the reading which is done
<em>thoroughly</em>, so thoroughly that the pupils completely master
both contents and language, and which therefore in both
these respects ought to be as good as possible. In
exercises with questions and answers, the contents naturally
play an important part, and even if the pupils feel it is one
aim, and a very important one, to acquire skill in the
language, yet this aim is not always directly kept in view as
such; neither does a child talk in order to practise using
its mother-tongue, but in order to get some information and
in order to communicate itself to others&mdash;and thereby it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
learns the language. This feeling of reality becomes more
and more prominent as the pupils become more advanced;
in the conversations, the pupils show directly, that they
understand the contents, indirectly that they understand
the language.</p>

<p>The pupils must <em>talk</em>&mdash;about what they have read, and
that the talks are not mere farces with conventional
“parleur” phrases, as our opponents would like to make
out, I hope that I have shown sufficiently well.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When
a certain teacher wrote somewhere that all the conversation
that there is time for consists of the following five questions,
which are asked of the monitor (and only of him) at the
beginning of every lesson: “Who is the monitor? What
date is it to-day? What day of the week is it?
Who is absent? What have you prepared for to-day?”,
and that he owes it to the truth to confess
that it is only the minority of the pupils who at the
end of the year are able to answer these questions correctly
without hesitation, then this deplorable result is primarily
due to the fewness of the questions; he who only gets the
tip of his finger dipped in the water three times in twenty
weeks will never learn how to swim. It is secondarily due
to the fact that the questions are stereotyped and have no
connection with what the class is reading. Furthermore
this same teacher says that he generally cannot spend more
than a few minutes of each lesson on these “elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
exercises,” since the reading, translation and grammar
requires the rest of the time, in the middle classes, indeed,
all the time, so that at this stage there is no time at
all for any conversation. But if the talks are used for
interpreting the text, two big birds are killed with one stone,
and then it will soon be seen that skill in speaking increases
like wealth; if you have only reached a certain point, the
rest comes of its own accord; the accumulated capital
multiplies surprisingly fast and willingly.</p>

<p>The pupils must <em>write</em>&mdash;original papers in the foreign
language, not translations&mdash;that is, the form of language
used must be as little as possible suggested by English
turns of expression. But the subject must be concrete and
limited. The chief danger that there may be in such
original written exercises, namely that the pupils avoid all
the difficulties and only use a slender supply of expressions,
which they feel sure of, this danger is greater the vaguer or
more comprehensive the subject is. For instance, it is best
not to give broad literary subjects, such as “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die romantische
schule</span>,” etc. A more limited subject is far better, both as
an exercise and as a test; for instance, an account of a
little anecdote or of the newspaper report of some event,
which the teacher has read to the class; a description of
what is to be seen on a picture, a renarration of some
episode in the novel or in the historical selection which is
being read in class, possibly in the form of a letter;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
summing up of everything relating to one of the characters
in the text read; a review of the line of thought in (a section
of) some essay which has been read; a paraphrase of some
poem. Still more limited are such exercises in which a
certain number of questions have to be answered, or such
exercises in the use of synonymous words and expressions
as have been described on p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>.</p>

<hr class="spaced" />

<p>But can such a method of instruction as has here been
described really be carried out under existing circumstances?
Are there not obstacles to be encountered on
every hand? Yes; unfortunately there are things which
stand in the way and make a good deal of trouble, but
luckily they do not make it quite impossible for the new
system to be used. As hindrances may be mentioned the
shortness of the time, the apportionment of the time, the
examinations, the teachers.</p>

<p>The <em>time</em> which is now set apart for modern languages
is too brief. Therefore all teachers of modern languages
ought to unite, and, together with all the parents who are
dissatisfied with the arrangements in our grammar schools
(and they are not few), they ought to agitate for the
removal of that burden which weighs heavily on the school
and which prevents the growing generation from getting an
education which can meet the urgent demands of our
times, I mean, the school must be delivered from the
classical languages; then there will be air and space for all
that is now shoved into the background, among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
things the modern foreign languages.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But&mdash;even in the
scanty time which is now at disposal, there is much that
can be done differently and better than hitherto, and the
more the teachers in modern languages show this, and the
more they can keep out of the old jogtrot way, the more
will their subject be respected, and the more willingness
will there be to extend the time when future reforms
demand it.</p>

<p>The <em>apportionment</em> of the time is poor. When will
people finally realize that everything cannot be learned at
once? Many subjects, and with so few hours a week for
each that the pupils forget what they have learned from one
lesson to the next&mdash;that is a frightful waste of time.</p>

<p>No, learn a few things or one thing at a time, learn everything
well and learn it to the end before passing on to the
next.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And especially with respect to languages, there can
be no doubt that it is best to take them up one after the
other, not side by side; to every language that is taken up
should be devoted many hours a week, and as a rule two
years ought to be allowed to pass before commencing a new
language; then the first is so firmly rooted in the minds of
the pupils that merely a very few lessons a week will be
sufficient for keeping it up and extending it,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
two languages do not injure each other nearly as much as if
they were studied side by side before the pupils have
mastered either one of them. As to the question at what
age the children ought to begin to learn foreign languages, I
dare not express any decided opinion; I think I should be
afraid to begin too early rather than too late; first let the
mother tongue have time enough to take a firm and lasting
hold of the child’s mind before other languages are
admitted.</p>

<p>The worst canker in our school-system<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> is the <em>examinations</em>.
Everything is arranged with a view to examinations;
the parents, the children, and unfortunately also a number
of the teachers care for nothing but the results attained in
the examinations; the daily instruction is left to shift for
itself, but the authorities will take ample care to guard
against the least bit of negligence which might be shown by
the examiners.</p>

<p>Examinations compel the teachers to lay undue stress on
cramming. “Cram may be defined as the accumulation of
undigested facts and second-hand theories to be reproduced
on paper, handed in to the examiner, and then forgotten
for ever. A crammed examinee differs from a crammed
Strasburg goose in not assimilating his nutriment, and this
would be a real advantage were it not that the process
leaves him with a nauseated appetite, enfeebled reasoning
powers, though abnormally enlarged memory, and a general
distaste for disinterested study.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Examinations cause the mental and physical ruin of
many more young men than we can afford. As a test of
what a young man is worth in life, an examination is without
any value whatever; as a test of how much really
valuable knowledge he has, it is not worth much; and even
as a test of how much he knows of what happens to be
asked him on such an occasion, an examination is not
nearly as reliable as people like to imagine.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> And then
examinations tend in so many ways to impede instruction
which would otherwise be really profitable. The question
“will that be required for the examination?” is always,
either consciously or unconsciously, present in the schoolroom;
it smothers the teacher’s enthusiasm for communicating
to his pupils what interests himself most; and it
discourages the pupils’ natural thirst for knowledge for its
own sake. Just before the examinations, the whole school
is seized with its yearly attack of its chronic examination-catarrh.
In all departments, it is considered necessary to
recapitulate for examinations; for a couple of months, the
pupils are transformed into mental ruminants; they receive
no new mental sustenance whatever, but have to be satisfied
with going through the whole year’s work once or twice
more at as rapid a pace as possible. The matter which
they have been given does not become more savoury on
being served again; all the juice and strength, all that
makes it tempting is lost, and nothing remains but what is
toughest and dryest.</p>

<p>But even if there is much fault to be found with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
system of examinations, yet it is not necessary to reform
that before we can begin to improve the instruction. The
examination requirements are not so great that we cannot
meet them even if we do not from the very beginning plan
all our instruction exactly with them in view. Although
the chief stress in the examination may be laid on the
translation and not on speaking, yet that is no reason why
the latter should be entirely dispensed with. If by a
<em>receptive</em> command of a foreign language is meant the ability
to understand it, and by a <em>productive</em> command, the power
to express oneself in the language, then I am fully convinced
that anyone who merely concerns himself with the
receptive side of it injures himself and acquires far less
ability to understand it than if he had from the very
beginning also aimed at a productive command of the
language. Therefore our all round exercises will give our
pupils at least just as much receptive knowledge of the
language as is attained by the pupils of others; and even if
it is rather provoking for a teacher who has taken a good
deal of trouble to teach his pupils to speak to see that this
counts for little or nothing at the examination, he can comfort
himself with a good conscience at any rate&mdash;beside the
pleasure which he and his pupils have had in their daily
work together.</p>

<p>Nor ought any consideration for examinations to prevent
anyone from the best kind of recapitulation, which is, not to
wait until the approach of examinations, when much that has
been read is forgotten, so that the teacher has to be on the
lookout all the time to make sure that the pupils understand
everything, but to take it up while the matter is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
fresh in the memory, so that it is not necessary to sound the
pupils on every little point. Every chapter ought to be
revised when it is finished, and every section or book ought
to be gone over as a whole. Then the thoughts which
were formerly occupied with details may be turned to
the connected whole, and since the work can be conducted
in the form of almost uninterrupted intelligent
reading aloud, the pupils will be enabled to get approximately
the same impression and the same enjoyment out
of the matter read as a native gets.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> If the reading has
thus been gone over a section at a time at each natural
break, it will be seen at the examination that these short
revisions distributed throughout the year are more advantageous
than a long, tedious recapitulation just before the
examination, and besides the pupils have been kept fresh
by reading something new up to the very end.</p>

<p>As the last possible impediment in the way of the reform
method, I mentioned the <em>teachers</em>. Those times are now
past when it was considered sufficient for a teacher of
modern languages to have taken a degree in law or theology&mdash;to
have studied Tacitus and Plato, and then by way of
amusement to have read by himself a few volumes of
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des deux mondes</cite> or some novels by Cherbuliez and
Freytag. But even the younger generation of teachers who
are better prepared will very often find that it is not so very
easy to give good instruction in modern languages. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
shame how little is done to give high-school teachers
opportunities for further improvement; they ought to have
abundant access to courses in advanced work, but especially
to many and liberal travelling scholarships, so that no
conscientious teacher in foreign languages need do without
a tolerably long stay among the people whose language
he (she) teaches. Poor pay and long hours, too, naturally
lead to a teacher’s looking merely to examination
results.</p>

<p>But still I continue to hope that more and more teachers
will avoid the old rut, and they will surely find that it
pays to get out of it, even if, especially in the beginning,
they have to expend more time and energy on their teaching,
and on their preparation for every lesson, in order to
meet the greater demands of the new methods. In Germany
and the Scandinavian countries, exceedingly great efforts
are being made to reform the instruction in languages; in
Norway, much of what has been recommended in this book
has even been adopted in the official school-plans issued
in 1897;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and fortunately the movement is also on the way
to becoming strong in England. If this book by a foreigner
can contribute ever so little to the encouragement and
support of English language-teachers in their zealous and
able efforts to introduce newer and better methods, then I
am glad to have been enabled in this manner to pay off a
little of the debt that I owe to England and to many
Englishmen.</p>

<p>In closing let me try to sum up. The old-fashioned
disconnected sentences proved to be a failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for many reasons, and one reason was because there was
nothing else to do with them but to translate them.
They could arouse no interest; they could not even be
read aloud intelligently; they could not be remembered
in that definite form which they happened to have, so
they could not be used as patterns for the construction
of other sentences; therefore the rules of the grammar,
which was committed to memory, came to play such an
important part. It all became monotonous and lifeless.</p>

<p>Our method tries to employ many means which
mutually support each other. The pronunciation is not
learned merely by the teacher’s saying the word and the
pupils repeating it, or by the pupil’s guessing at it through
the orthography and the teacher’s correcting him. The
latter plan we reject entirely; the former, however, we
use even to a larger extent than before, and we adopt
in addition to it a rational description and indication of
sounds. The improved pronunciation thus acquired also
helps in a high degree in the acquiring of the other
(signification) side of the language. Where formerly
there was no other way of communicating the meaning
of words but through translation, we have in addition
thereto direct and indirect observation, explanations in
the foreign language, etc. Where the pupils formerly
had to commit to memory paradigms, rigmaroles and
rules, which all had to be taken on faith, we let them
investigate for themselves and thus get an insight into
the construction of the language. And whereas formerly
the only exercises were translation from the mother
tongue into the foreign language, we now have a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
scale of varying exercises, namely: direct reproduction
(repetition of the teacher’s words; answers to questions
which are based directly upon the words of the book)&mdash;modified
reproduction (repetition of sentences with changes
of tense, person, etc.; answers to freer questions; asking
of questions)&mdash;free reproduction (renarration) and finally&mdash;free
production (letters, etc.). And since there is a
sensible meaning in all that is read or said or done,
the interest is awakened and held, and the instruction
becomes not only varied, but what especially beseems
living languages, it becomes in the deepest and best
sense of the word really <em>living</em>.</p>

in the thorough manner which I have suggested, will be surprised at the
strong powers of association produced by successiveness; one word
always recalls the whole context in which it has been learned. In one
of the exercises given by Walter, pupil A mentions one of the words which
the class has had and then the name of pupil B, who is thereupon
expected to give the whole sentence in which the word occurs. Of
course this can be done now and then by way of recreation; as a rule
it is not necessary. This new method of always learning and remembering
the words in their natural context may be compared to the newest
methods in natural history teaching, according to which the pupils
must see the animals and plants as they are at home in their natural
surroundings, acted upon by them and in turn acting upon them.</p></div>

to the end with as much thoroughness as is possible at <em>that</em> standpoint.
Grammar ought not to be taken up during the lesson merely
as a matter of secondary importance, subordinated to other exercises,
whose object is to help the pupils to understand the text, or to develop
their practical skill in the language. If the teacher does not want to
devote a whole hour to the grammar, he can at least draw a sharp
line between these exercises in theory and the other exercises. One
thing at a time, and that done well!</p></div>

the boys having to sort “a hundredweight or so of slips,” I think his
exaggeration needs no further refutation than the above statements,
which are nothing but an amplification of what I wrote in 1886.

class had to voice the sound when I raised my hand, and unvoice it
when I lowered my hand; thus I have made them articulate
fffvvvffvvvff, ssszzsss, etc., without any pauses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> That I am not exaggerating (as people certainly will suspect in
about ten years from now), I could easily prove by means of a long
series of opinions from pedagogical meetings, articles in pedagogical
periodicals, newspaper reviews, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> I have sometimes made the introduction longer, sometimes shorter
than here indicated; some teachers make it more complete, so that
they get a whole system of sounds tabulated before they pass on to
the reading.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> But stopped consonants, like <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, are exceptions to these
instructions to isolate the sounds&mdash;every phonetician knows the reason
why. They should be uttered with a vowel before and one after, e.g.
<i>ata</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> With the exception of the vowels [a·] in <i>alms</i>, [ɔ·] in <i>war</i>, and
[ə·] in <i>sir</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> This method of procedure follows in the main the suggestions of
Klinghardt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> If the teacher does not care to prepare such charts himself, he can
use Viëtor’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauttafeln</span>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Besides, the different systems of modern phoneticians all resemble
each other very much&mdash;far more than did the earlier arbitrary
methods of designating the pronunciation (for instance, Walker’s,
Flügel’s, Toussaint-Langenscheidt’s, Tanger’s, etc.). Any one who has
learned Sweet’s phonetical transcription can easily read Passy’s or my
own, and vice versâ; the differences are hardly worth speaking of.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> I remember a lady’s dismay when a Frenchman used the combination
[stane] in a sentence; she could not understand the sentence until
I repeated it, inserting [sɛtane]. “O well,” she rejoined, “if he had
only said [sɛtane]; we always said it that way in school.” (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette année.</i>)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The use of the French or German names of the letters of the
alphabet when words are being spelled in English is merely affectation,
and deserves only a shrug of the shoulders, especially since, as a rule,
it is not consistently carried through, but is applied only to some few
letters, <i>y</i> being called [igræk] or <i>ypsilon</i>, <i>ch</i>, [seaʃ] or [tseha], according
to circumstances, and this in the midst of other letters which are
allowed to retain their English names with diphthongs and everything.
It is quite a different thing when the teaching is wholly conducted in
the foreign language; then it is necessary to practise the foreign names
of the letters, but then it must be carried through consistently.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
